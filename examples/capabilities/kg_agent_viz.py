"""
Example: AI Agent Building and Visualizing Knowledge Graph

Demonstrates an AI agent using KnowledgeGraph tools to remember information,
then visualizing what it learned using the visualization APIs.

Shows:
1. Agent learns from text using knowledge graph tools
2. Agent recalls and connects information
3. Visualize the knowledge graph using three-level API:
   - Low-level: kg.mermaid() - raw Mermaid code
   - Medium-level: kg.render(format) - multiple formats
   - High-level: kg.display() - Jupyter inline rendering

Usage:
    uv run python examples/capabilities/kg_agent_viz.py
