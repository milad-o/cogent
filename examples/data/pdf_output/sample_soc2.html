<p>Scope</p>
<p>We have examined OneTrust, LLC’s (“OneTrust” or the “service organization”) accompanying description of its</p>
<p>“description”), based on the criteria for a description of a service organization’s system in DC section 200, 2018 ® Report (AICPA, Description Description Criteria for a Description of a Service Organization’s System in a SOC 2 Criteria) (“description criteria”), and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls stated in the</p>
<p>service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the trust services criteria relevant to security, availability, and confidentiality (“applicable trust services criteria”) set forth in TSP section 100, Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (AICPA, Trust Services Criteria).</p>
<p>OneTrust uses a subservice organization for cloud hosting and managed database services.  The description indicates that complementary subservice organization controls that are suitably designed and operating effectively are necessary, along with controls at OneTrust, to achieve OneTrust’s service commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria.  The description presents OneTrust’s controls, the applicable trust services criteria, and the types of complementary subservice organization controls assumed in the design of OneTrust’s controls.  The description does not disclose the actual controls at the subservice organization. Our examination did not include the services provided by the subservice organization, and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such complementary subservice organization controls.</p>
<p>Service Organization’s Responsibilities</p>
<p>OneTrust is responsible for its service commitments and system requirements and for designing, implementing, and operating effective controls within the system to provide reasonable assurance that OneTrust’s service commitments and system requirements were achieved.  OneTrust has provided the accompanying assertion, in Section 2, (“assertion”) about the description and the suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls stated therein.  OneTrust is also responsible for preparing the description and assertion, including the completeness, accuracy, and method of presentation of the description and assertion; providing the services covered by the description; selecting the applicable trust services criteria and stating the related controls in the description; and identifying the risks that threaten the achievement of the service organization’s service commitments and system requirements.</p>
<p>Service Auditor’s Responsibilities</p>
<p>Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the description and on the suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls stated in the description based on our examination.  Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.  Those standards require that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, the description is presented in accordance with the description criteria and the controls stated therein were suitably designed and operated effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization’s service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria.  We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>

<p>Infrastructure and Software</p>
<p>OneTust utilizes Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) cloud hosting services to provide the resources to host the Certification Automation system.  Within various AWS regions, three copies of the system are maintained, two hosted in the United States (U.S.) and one hosted in the European Union (EU).  The application stack is composed of a frontend JavaScript application (utilizing React/Redux) and a backend Python API (utilizing Python 3.10).  Nginx is utilized as a web server with gunicorn as the Python container.</p>
<p>The Certification Automation system stack in the US is deployed in a VPC in the US-EAST-1 (N. Virginia) region as the primary region with US-WEST-2 (Oregon) as the secondary.  The other U.S. region resides in California (CA) known as CA-CENTRAL-1 (Central).  This location has no secondary region.  The application stack in the EU runs in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in the EU-CENTRAL-1 (Frankfurt) region as the primary region and secondary configured as EU-WEST-1 (Ireland).  It currently does not have a secondary region as CA only has one available.</p>
<p>The back-end API application runs in AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) behind an AWS Elastic Load Bearing (ELB).  The front-end JavaScript (JS) application is served from CloudFront, with the assets hosted in Simple Storage Service (S3).  All applications utilize AWS ECS for background tasks and utilize AWS API Gateway for the custom API integration feature.</p>
<p>The database supporting the application is utilizing AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) running PostgreSQL 13.4 and is replicated in real-time to the secondary region.  AWS ElastiCache (redis) is also utilized.  S3 is utilized to store user-uploaded files and is replicated in real-time to the secondary region.  CloudWatch is utilized for both monitoring and log storage.  Encryption keys are managed through the AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Access to the keys is restricted to a small number of senior team members.</p>
<p>The platform is a SaaS-multi-tenant client server application.  Customers receive their own tenant in the Certification Automation system, and their data is encrypted and logically separated and not accessible to other tenants to prevent unauthorized access.  Client data locations and data flows are outlined in the diagram below along with the security measures in place to protect this data.</p>

<p>Research and Development (R&amp;D) and Quality Assurance (QA)</p>
<p>R&amp;D applies agile methodologies and problem-solving skills to design, develop, and unit test applications deployed to Azure and assists with cloud application architecture.  Additionally, R&amp;D carries out QA audits to ensure that documentation and controls designs are appropriate for the software, then addresses quality issues and follows up and closes pending preventive and corrective action requests.  Finally, the Operations roles support OneTrust's infrastructure by using automation to deploy software, configuration changes, and infrastructure changes; to troubleshoot software and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) problems in its cloud environment; and to support application infrastructure to ensure that the software is optimized for performance and reliability.</p>
<p>Procedures</p>
<p>OneTrust maintains and documents operating technology standards and procedures in order to provide staff with centralized up-to-date references and training aids.  OneTrust’s policies and procedures contain guidance regarding aspects of computer usage and security.</p>
<p>OneTrust has implemented both automated and procedural controls through system tools and through policies and procedures to create the internal control framework.  Management’s involvement in day-to-day operations allows for real-time review of the operating effectiveness of internal controls.</p>
<p>OneTrust has documented and communicated policies and procedures to its employees to restrict logical access to OneTrust’s systems based on the principle of least privilege.  These procedures cover the following key security lifecycle areas:</p>
<p>•• Management of access and roles  Policy management and communication</p>
<p>•• Incident response  Selection, documentation, and implementation of security controls • Maintenance of restricted access to system • Authorization, changes to, and termination configurations, administrative functionality, of information system access passwords, powerful utilities, and security devices • Password protocol</p>
<p>• Monitoring security controls</p>
<p>Access, Authentication, and Authorization</p>
<p>OneTrust applies the principle of least privilege and restricts access to the production environment only to those requiring access to perform their job function.  Access to the infrastructure within AWS requires initial access to a hardened jump server which requires an Active Directory (AD) account, and the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA).  Accounts within AD are unique to specific individuals and sharing of the accounts is prohibited.  AD security groups are utilized to ensure functions performed within the production environment are limited based on a user’s role within the organization.  AD password requirements are also in place to enforce predefined minimum password requirements according to documented policies.  Remote sessions to the production environment are configured to automatically terminate after a predefined time period of inactivity.  Access to perform administrative functions within the production environment and to the AWS management console is restricted to personnel commensurate with their job role.</p>
<p>Additionally, system components are configured such that the organization and its customers' access is segmented from other tenant users.</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>Access Requests and Access Revocation</p>
<p>Access to in-scope system components require a documented access request along with manager approval prior to access being provisioned.  Termination notifications are provided to relevant teams in the event of an employee termination and system access is revoked as part of the termination process.  The identity management system is configured to sync with the HR system to automatically deactivate Entra ID (Azure) user accounts in the event that an employee’s employment status is no longer active in the HR system.  Quarterly access reviews are performed by management to ensure access to systems within the environment is appropriate.</p>
<p>Change Management</p>
<p>OneTrust maintains and documents change management policies and procedures to guide personnel on application and infrastructure changes to the production environment.  A formal system development life cycle (SDLC) methodology is established that governs the development, acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of application development and enhancement projects.</p>
<p>Changes to the production environment are documented within a ticketing system and require approval prior to implementation.  Additionally, application changes require documented testing to be performed by QA personnel on an as needed basis, and back out plans are documented on an as needed basis for infrastructure changes prior to being implemented.</p>
<p>Separate environments are maintained for the development and testing purposes from the production environment. OneTrust uses non-production data (fictitious data) within the development and testing environments.  Changes are migrated to production by authorized personnel based on job responsibilities.  Logging is enabled to monitor activities such as administrative activities, logon attempts, changes to functions, security configurations, permissions, and roles.  Automated alerts are configured to notify IT management and issues identified are resolved in a timely manner through the incident management process.</p>
<p>Release notes for changes that affect the system are documented and communicated to internal and external users.</p>
<p>System Security and System Monitoring</p>
<p>OneTrust utilizes a web application firewall is also in place and is configured to protect against external web-based attacks.  Anti-malware software is deployed on production servers and workstations and is configured to scan registered endpoints in real-time.  A Data Loss Prevention (DLP) application is configured to prevent the use of removable media devices on registered endpoints.  Additionally, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tool is configured to notify system administrators of potential unauthorized movement of sensitive information.</p>
<p>In order to help ensure production capacity is adequate, OneTrust utilizes enterprise monitoring software to monitor system capacity, and availability issues are configured to alert cloud personnel when pre-defined thresholds are met.

<h3>CE ONTROL NVIRONMENT</h3>
<p>The control environment at OneTrust is the foundation for the other areas of internal control.  It sets the tone of the organization and influences the control consciousness of its personnel.  The components of the control environment factors include the integrity and ethical values; management’s commitment to competence; its organizational structure; the assignment of authority and responsibility; and the oversight and direction provided by executive management and operations management.</p>
<p>Integrity and Ethical Values</p>
<p>A “tone at the top” is established by OneTrust, including explicit guidance about what is right and wrong.  This tone is communicated and practiced by executives and management throughout the organization.  The importance of high ethics and controls is discussed with newly hired employees throughout the interview process and orientation. Employees must acknowledge the employee handbook upon hire, which describes the responsibilities and expected behavior with regard to data and information system usage.  New employees are also subjected to background and reference checks prior to joining the organization.  A formalized whistleblower policy is established, and an anonymous communication channel is available for employees to report potential security issues or fraud concerns.</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>Executive Management, Board of Directors, and Audit Committee Oversight</p>
<p>The IMS Committee has been appointed to provide oversight for the development and performance of internal control.  The committee meets on a quarterly basis and maintains formal meeting minutes.  The IMS Committee responsibilities, inclusive of the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and continual improvement of the IMS, are documented within the information security policy.  These responsibilities include ensuring that information security and privacy policies and objectives are established and compatible with the strategic direction of the company.  The chair of the IMS Committee is responsible for reporting performance to OneTrust’s CEO and others, as relevant.</p>
<p>The organization also performs an internal audit on an annual basis to ensure compliance with organizational policies and procedures and to identify new risks.</p>
<p>OneTrust's Board of Directors consists of the CEO and three independent non-employee directors.  The Board provides strategic direction and drives accountability, while overseeing the governance, compliance, reporting, and financials of the organization.</p>
<p>Organizational Structure and Assignment of Authority and Responsibility</p>
<p>OneTrust has established lines of reporting that facilitate the flow of information to appropriate personnel.  Roles and responsibilities are segregated based on functional requirements.  OneTrust has documented an organization chart that sets forth the company’s lines of reporting and is updated as necessary.</p>
<p>Management and employees are assigned levels of authority and responsibility to facilitate effective internal control.</p>
<p>Commitment to Competence</p>
<p>OneTrust’s has established a framework for the basic skills necessary to perform each of the jobs at OneTrust. This framework is then augmented with more specific requirements for each position and for additional specialization within each position based upon any other skills an employee may have.  Job descriptions are documented for employees to define the skills and knowledge levels required for the competence levels of jobs. Candidates looking to work at the company are assessed during interviewing to determine if their skills match the requirements of the position and to determine if the candidate fits the company culture.  Management is required to provide feedback to HR during candidate interviewing to assess the competency of the candidate prior to being offered a position.  New employees are subjected to background and reference checks prior to joining the organization.  Employees are also required to undergo mandatory security and privacy training upon hire, and on an annual basis thereafter.  Employees' performance is also evaluated by managers on at least an annual basis.</p>
<p>Accountability</p>
<p>OneTrust’s senior management takes a “hands on” approach and are heavily involved in all phases of business operations.  OneTrust has company-wide staff meetings on a quarterly basis that enable senior management to remain in close contact with all personnel and to consistently emphasize appropriate behavior to personnel and to key vendor personnel.</p>
<p>OneTrust maintains formal hiring, employment, and termination policies and procedures.  Employees are subject to background checks, must successfully complete privacy and security training, and are subject to disciplinary action as a result of policy violations or acts that are deemed contrary to the company’s mission and objectives. Job descriptions are documented for employees to define the knowledge and skillset required for the competence levels of jobs.</p>

<h3>RA ISK SSESSMENT</h3>
<p>Objective Setting</p>
<p>OneTrust identifies risks to the achievement of its objectives across the entity and analyzes risks as a basis for determining how to manage them.  Documented policies and procedures are in place to guide personnel when performing the risk assessment process.  The process incorporates the security program by reviewing security testing and include items that need remediation.  Management has committed to customers to carry out certain objectives in relation to the services provided.  OneTrust has a risk assessment process to identify and manage risks that could affect the company’s ability to provide reliable services to its clients.  This process requires management to identify significant risks in their areas of responsibility and to implement measures to address those risks.  In designing its controls, the company has considered the risks that could prevent it from effectively addressing the criteria under the security, availability, and confidentiality Trust Services Criteria.  As part of this process, threats and changes to service commitments are identified and the risks are formally assessed.  A documented risk management program is in place that includes guidance on the identification of potential threats, rating the significance of the risks associated with the identified threats, and mitigation strategies for those risks.</p>
<p>Risk Identification and Analysis</p>
<p>After objectives have been defined, risks are identified.  The risk identification process includes the consideration of both internal and external factors and their impact on the achievement of the objectives.</p>
<p>OneTrust identifies and assesses changes that could significantly impact the system of internal control.  The risk identification process considers changes to the regulatory, economic, and physical environment in which the company operates.  OneTrust also considers the potential impacts of new business lines, dramatically altered compositions of existing business lines, acquired or divested business operations, rapid growth, and new technologies on the system of internal control.</p>
<p>Subsequently, identified risks are analyzed through a process that includes estimating the potential significance of the risk.  Risks are assigned a score based on the combined level of impact and likelihood of the risk occurring, ranging from low to critical impact and unlikely to expected likelihood.  Risks are then formally documented with mitigation strategies for management review.</p>
<p>Risk Factors</p>
<p>Management considers risks that can arise from both external and internal factors including the following:</p>
<p>External Factors</p>
<p>• Technological developments</p>
<p>• Competition that could alter marketing or service activities</p>
<p>• New legislation and regulation that could force changes in policies and strategies</p>
<p>• Economic changes that could have an impact on management decisions</p>
<p>Internal Factors</p>
<p>• Significant changes in policies, processes, or personnel</p>
<p>• Types of fraud</p>
<p>• Fraud incentives and pressures for employees</p>
<p>• Fraud opportunities</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>• Employee attitudes and rationalizations for fraud</p>
<p>• A disruption in information systems processing</p>
<p>Potential for Fraud</p>
<p>OneTrust considers the potential for fraud in assessing risks to the achievement of objectives.  The assessment of fraud risk considers fraudulent reporting, possible loss of assets, or data and corruption resulting from the various ways that fraud and misconduct can occur.  It also considers opportunities for unauthorized acquisition, use or disposal of assets, altering of the entity’s reporting records, or committing other inappropriate acts and how management and other personnel might engage in or justify inappropriate actions.</p>
<p>Risk Mitigation</p>
<p>Documented policies and procedures are in place to guide personnel in identifying and selecting and developing risk management strategies as a component of the annual risk assessment.  Upon completion of the annual risk assessment, OneTrust has implemented a risk mitigation procedure for the risks identified during the risk assessment.  Risks are documented with mitigation strategies and are reviewed during the quarterly IMS Management Committee quarterly meetings.</p>
<h3>TSCRCA RUST ERVICES RITERIA AND ELATED ONTROL CTIVITIES</h3>
<p>Integration with Risk Assessment</p>
<p>Along with assessing risks, management has identified and put into effect actions needed to address those risks. In order to address risks, control activities have been placed into operation to help ensure that the actions are carried out properly and efficiently.  Control activities serve as mechanisms for managing the achievement of the security, availability, and confidentiality categories.</p>
<p>Selection and Development of Control Activities</p>
<p>The applicable trust services criteria and related control activities are included in Section 4 of this report to eliminate the redundancy that would result from listing the items in this section and repeating them in Section 4.  Although the applicable trust services criteria and related control activities are included in Section 4, they are, nevertheless, an integral part of OneTrust’s description of the system.</p>
<p>The description of the service auditor’s tests of operating effectiveness and the results of those tests are also presented in Section 4, the Testing Matrices, adjacent to the service organization’s description of controls.  The description of the tests of operating effectiveness and the results of those tests are the responsibility of the service auditor and should be considered information provided by the service auditor.</p>
<p>Trust Services Criteria Not Applicable to the In-Scope System</p>
<p>All criteria within the security, availability, and confidentiality categories are applicable to the Certification Automation system.</p>

<h3>ICS NFORMATION AND OMMUNICATION YSTEMS</h3>
<p>OneTrust obtains or generates and uses relevant information to support the functioning of internal control.  OneTrust maintains architectural diagrams and procedural documentation to allow for identification of data sources, responsible personnel, and other relevant information.  OneTrust has methods in place to help information systems maintain and produce information that is timely, current, accurate, and complete.</p>
<p>Internal Communications</p>
<p>OneTrust maintains information security policies to help ensure that employees understand their individual roles and responsibilities concerning processing and controls to ensure significant events are communicated in a timely manner.  These include training programs and the use of e-mail to communicate time sensitive information and processes for security and system availability purposes that notify key personnel in the event of potential security issues or system outages.</p>
<p>External Communications</p>
<p>OneTrust provides external users with guidelines and technical support resources relating to system operations on OneTrust’s website.  OneTrust provides an external-facing support system and contact information to allow users to report system information on failures, incidents, concerns, and other complaints to appropriate personnel. OneTrust notifies customers of critical changes that may affect their processing.</p>
<h3>M ONITORING</h3>
<p>Monitoring is a process that assesses the quality of internal control performance over time.  It involves assessing the design and operation of controls and taking necessary corrective actions.  This process is accomplished through ongoing activities, separate evaluation, or a combination of the two.  Monitoring activities also include using information from communications from external parties such as user entity complaints and regulatory comments that may indicate problems or highlight areas in need of improvement.  Management has implemented a self- assessment and compliance program to ensure the controls are consistently applied as designed.</p>
<p>Ongoing Monitoring</p>
<p>OneTrust’s management performs monitoring activities in order to assess the quality of internal control over time, monitors activities throughout the year, and takes corrective actions to address deviations from company policy and procedures.  Management utilizes a risk-based approach to monitor business units and other auditable entities throughout the organization, ensuring that enterprise-wide risks are prioritized and addressed in order of significance.</p>
<p>OneTrust monitors customer communications through the Professional Services and Support department.  This information is provided to management providing the ability to track, monitor, and assist in understanding customer complaints, concerns, and to evaluate and resolve special requests in a timely fashion.  Management’s ability to actively monitor customer communications is an integral role in controlling the quality of the services provided.</p>
<p>Management is proactive in responding to customer complaints and there is a high level of inter-departmental communication about these events.  Customer complaints and other issues are handled through an internal ticketing system and by personal contact by management staff.  Major customer-facing issues are reported to management for discussion and approval of action.</p>
<p>OneTrust utilizes monitoring tools to monitor system security and performance events such as failed access attempts, intrusion signature detection, firewall events, central processing unit (CPU), and memory usage. Monitoring systems are configured to notify personnel when pre-defined thresholds are met and are followed up with and remediated.</p>

<p>Separate Evaluations</p>
<p>The IMS Committee is responsible for providing oversight for the development and performance of internal controls. The committee meets on a quarterly basis to review security incidents and various other metrics to determine the effectiveness of internal controls.  Additionally, the organization performs an internal audit on an annual basis to ensure compliance with organizational policies and procedures and to identify new risks.  Vulnerability scans are performed on a daily basis to identify threats and vulnerabilities to the production systems.  Issues identified are analyzed and remediated in a timely manner.  OneTrust also contracts with a third-party to perform penetration testing on an annual basis to identify vulnerabilities and deficiencies.</p>
<p>Subservice Organization Monitoring</p>
<p>The externally supported systems managed by AWS that support the Certification Automation system are monitored daily by OneTrust IT personnel as part of the day-to-day IT and business operations.  Vendor risk assessments are performed at least annually for critical vendors, and any exceptions identified in the assessment are evaluated to determine the impact on service.  OneTrust also obtains and reviews third-party attestation and compliance reports for AWS on at least an annual basis to monitor and evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls in place at the subservice organization to safeguard client data.</p>
<p>Evaluating and Communicating Deficiencies</p>
<p>OneTrust evaluates and communicates internal control deficiencies to those parties responsible for taking corrective action, including senior management and the board of managers, as appropriate.  Guidelines for reporting deficiencies have been developed and are provided to all employees.  The IMS Committee meets on a quarterly basis to review reported security incidents.</p>
<p>There were no identified significant system incidents that (a) were the result of controls that were not suitably designed or operating effectively to achieve one or more of the service commitments and system requirements or (b) otherwise resulted in a significant failure in the achievement of one or more of those service commitments and system requirements during the period.</p>

<p>Tests of Operating Effectiveness</p>
<p>The tests applied to test the operating effectiveness of controls are listed alongside each of the respective control activities within the Testing Matrices.  Such tests were considered necessary to evaluate whether the controls were sufficient to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the applicable trust services criteria were achieved during the period.  In selecting the tests of controls, Schellman considered various factors including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>• the nature of the control and the frequency with which it operates;</p>
<p>• the control risk mitigated by the control;</p>
<p>• the effectiveness of entity-level controls, especially controls that monitor other controls;</p>
<p>• the degree to which the control relies on the effectiveness of other controls; and</p>
<p>• whether the control is manually performed or automated.</p>
<p>The types of tests performed with respect to the operational effectiveness of the control activities detailed in this section are briefly described below:</p>

<p>Sampling</p>
<p>Consistent with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) authoritative literature, Schellman utilizes professional judgment to consider the tolerable deviation rate, the expected deviation rate, the audit risk, the characteristics of the population, and other factors, in order to determine the number of items to be selected in a sample for a particular test.  Schellman, in accordance with AICPA authoritative literature, selected samples in such a way that the samples were expected to be representative of the population.  This included judgmental selection methods, where applicable, to ensure representative samples were obtained.</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>System-generated population listings were obtained whenever possible to ensure completeness prior to selecting samples.  In some instances, full populations were tested in cases including but not limited to, the uniqueness of the event or low overall population size.</p>
<p>Reliability of Information Provided by the Service Organization</p>
<p>Observation and inspection procedures were performed related to certain system-generated reports, listings, and queries to assess the accuracy and completeness (reliability) of the information used in the performance of our testing of the controls.</p>
<p>Test Results</p>
<p>The results of each test applied are listed alongside each respective test applied within the Testing Matrices.  Test results not deemed as control deviations are noted by the phrase “No exceptions noted.” in the test result column of the Testing Matrices.  Any phrase other than the aforementioned, constitutes either a test result that is the result of non-occurrence, a change in the application of the control activity, or a deficiency in the operating effectiveness of the control activity.  Testing deviations identified within the Testing Matrices are not necessarily weaknesses in the total system of controls, as this determination can only be made after consideration of controls in place at user entities and subservice organizations, if applicable, and other factors.  Control considerations that should be implemented by subservice organizations, in order to complement the control activities and achieve the applicable trust services criteria are presented in the “Subservice Organizations” section within Section 3.</p>
