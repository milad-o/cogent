## **4. Employee's Social Security Number (SSN)** 

You’re required to get each employee's name and SSN and to enter them on Form W-2. An employee's SSN consists of nine digits arranged as follows: 000-00-0000. This requirement also applies to resident and nonresident alien employees. You should ask your employee to show you their social security card, but the employee isn't required to show the card if it isn't available. However, if an employee can't provide their social security card, you should verify their SSN and their eligibility for employment as discussed later in this section under _Verification of SSNs_ . 

_Don't accept a social security card that says “Not_ **!** _valid for employment.” An SSN issued with this_ **CAUTION** _legend doesn't permit employment._ 

You may, but aren't required to, photocopy the social security card if the employee provides it. If you don't provide the correct employee name and SSN on Form W-2, you may owe a penalty unless you have reasonable cause. See Pub. 1586, Reasonable Cause Regulations & Requirements for Missing and Incorrect Name/TINs on Information Returns, for information on the requirement to solicit the employee's SSN. 

_In many cases, a replacement social security card_ **TIP** _can be applied for online without visiting an SSA office. In some cases, an SSN application can also be started online before visiting an SSA office. For more information, go to SSA.gov/number-card._ 

**Applying for a social security card.** Any employee who is legally eligible to work in the United States and doesn't have a social security card can get one by completing Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, and submitting the necessary documentation. You can get Form SS-5 from the SSA website at _SSA.gov/forms/ ss-5.pdf_ , at SSA offices, or by calling 800-772-1213 or 800-325-0778 (TTY). The employee must complete and sign Form SS-5; it can't be filed by the employer. You may be asked to supply a letter to accompany Form SS-5 if the employee has exceeded their yearly or lifetime limit for the number of replacement cards allowed.

**Applying for an SSN.** If you file Form W-2 on paper and your employee applied for an SSN but doesn't have one when you must file Form W-2, enter “Applied For” on the form. If you’re filing electronically, enter all zeros (000-00-0000 if creating forms online or 000000000 if uploading a file) in the SSN field. When the employee receives the SSN, file Copy A of Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, with the SSA to show the employee's SSN. Furnish Copies B, C, and 2 of Form W-2c to the employee. Up to 25 Forms W-2c for each Form W-3c, Transmittal of Corrected Wage and Tax Statements, may be filed per session online with no limit on the number of sessions. For more information, go to the SSA's Employer W-2 Filing Instructions & Information webpage at _SSA.gov/employer_ . Advise your employee to correct the SSN on their original Form W-2. 

**Correctly record the employee's name and SSN.** Record the name and SSN of each employee as they’re shown on the employee's social security card. If the employee's name isn't correct as shown on the card (for example, because of marriage or divorce), the employee should request an updated card from the SSA. Continue to report the employee's wages under the old name until the employee shows you the updated social security card with the corrected name. 

If the SSA issues the employee an updated card after a name change, or a new card with a different SSN after a change in alien work status, file a Form W-2c to correct the name/SSN reported for the most recently filed Form W-2. It isn't necessary to correct other years if the previous name and number were used for years before the most recent Form W-2. 

**IRS individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs) for aliens.** Don't accept an ITIN in place of an SSN for employee identification or for work. An ITIN is only available to resident and nonresident aliens who aren't eligible for U.S. employment and need identification for other tax purposes. You can identify an ITIN because it is a nine-digit number, formatted like an SSN, that starts with the number "9" and has a range of numbers from “50– 65,” “70–88,” “90–92,” and “94–99” for the fourth and fifth digits (for example, 9NN-7N-NNNN). For more information about ITINs, see the Instructions for Form W-7 or go to _IRS.gov/ITIN_ .
