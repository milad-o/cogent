**Payer designated under section 3504.** In certain circumstances, the IRS may designate a third-party payer to perform the acts of an employer. The IRS will designate a third-party payer on behalf of an employer if the third party has a service agreement with the employer. A service agreement is an agreement between the third-party payer and an employer in which the third-party payer (1) asserts it is the employer of individuals performing services for the employer; (2) pays wages to the individuals that perform services for the employer; and (3) assumes responsibility to withhold, report, and pay federal employment taxes for the wages it pays to the individuals who perform services for the employer. 

A payer designated under section 3504 performs tax duties under the service agreement using its own EIN. If the IRS designates a third-party payer under section 3504, the designated payer and the employer are jointly liable for the employment taxes and related tax duties for which the third-party payer is designated. 

For more information on a payer designated under section 3504, see Regulations section 31.3504-2. 

**Certified professional employer organization (CPEO).** The Stephen Beck, Jr., ABLE Act of 2014 required the IRS to establish a voluntary certification program for professional employer organizations (PEOs). PEOs handle various payroll administration and tax reporting responsibilities for their business clients and are typically paid a fee based on payroll costs. To become and remain certified under the certification program, CPEOs must meet various requirements described in sections 3511 and 7705 and related published guidance. Certification as a CPEO may affect the employment tax liabilities of both the CPEO and its customers. A CPEO is generally treated for employment tax purposes as the employer of any individual who performs services for a customer of the CPEO and is covered by a contract described in section 7705(e)(2) between the CPEO and the customer (CPEO contract), but only for wages and other compensation paid to the individual by the CPEO. However, with respect to certain employees covered by a CPEO contract, you may also be treated as an employer of the employees and, consequently, may also be liable for federal employment taxes imposed on wages and other compensation paid by the CPEO to such employees. 

CPEOs must complete Schedule R (Form 940), Schedule R (Form 941), or Schedule R (Form 943) when filing an aggregate Form 940, Form 941, or Form 943, respectively. CPEOs file Form 8973 to notify the IRS that they started or ended a service contract with a customer. To become a CPEO, the organization must apply through the IRS Online Registration System. For more information or to apply to become a CPEO, go to _IRS.gov/CPEO_ . Also see _Revenue Procedure 2023-18_ . 

_If both an employer and a section 3504 authorized_ **TIP** _agent (or CPEO or other third-party payer) paid wages to an employee during a quarter, both the employer and the section 3504 authorized agent (or CPEO or other third-party payer, if applicable) should file Form 941 reporting the wages each entity paid to the employee during the applicable quarter and issue Forms W-2_ 

_reporting the wages each entity paid to the employee during the year._ 

**17. Federal Agency Certifying Requirements of Federal Income Taxes Withheld From U.S. Government Employees Working in, or Federal Pension Recipients Residing in, American Samoa, the CNMI, and Guam** 

## **Special Certifying Requirements for Federal Agencies** 

This section sets forth the legal authorities requiring federal agencies to certify to the IRS the amount of federal income taxes withheld from amounts paid to U.S. Government employees working in, as well as federal civilian and military pensioners residing in, American Samoa, the CNMI, and Guam. As noted below, these special certifying requirements don't apply to federal agencies who have employees working in Puerto Rico or the USVl. 

## **American Samoa** 

Code sections 931(a), 931(d), and 7654 provide that the U.S. Government is required to transfer (“cover over”) to the Treasury of American Samoa the federal income taxes withheld on amounts paid to military and civilian employees and pensioners who are residents of American Samoa. The effect of these provisions is that the federal government transfers on at least an annual basis the federal income taxes withheld or collected from its employees and pensioners who are residents of American Samoa to the American Samoa Treasury. In order for the federal government to cover over these income taxes as required by law, federal agencies must certify the amount of federal income taxes withheld or collected from its employees and pensioners by following the procedures discussed under _Certification Procedures_ , later in this section. 

## **Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands**
