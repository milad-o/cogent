**Reporting and resolving your tax-related identity theft issues.** 

- Tax-related identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information to commit tax fraud. Your taxes can be affected if your EIN is used to file a fraudulent return or to claim a refund or credit. 

- The IRS doesn’t initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages (including shortened links), telephone calls, or social media channels to request or verify personal or financial information. This includes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, or similar information for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts. 

- Go to _IRS.gov/IdentityTheft_ , the IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protection for taxpayers, tax professionals, and businesses. If your EIN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take. 

**Making a tax payment.** Payments of U.S. tax must be remitted to the IRS in U.S. dollars. _Digital assets_ are **not** accepted. Go to _IRS.gov/Payments_ for information on how to make a payment using any of the following options. 

- _Debit Card, Credit Card, or Digital Wallet_ : Choose an approved payment processor to pay online or by phone. 

- _Electronic Funds Withdrawal_ : Schedule a payment when filing your federal taxes using tax return preparation software or through a tax professional. 

- _Electronic Federal Tax Payment System_ : This is the best option for businesses. Enrollment is required.
