- The business is co-owned by both spouses and isn't held in the name of a state law entity such as a partnership or limited liability company (LLC). 

To make the election, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit must be divided between the spouses, in accordance with each spouse's interest in the venture, and reported as sole proprietors on a separate Schedule C (Form 1040) or Schedule F (Form 1040). Each spouse must also file a separate Schedule SE (Form 1040) to pay self-employment taxes, as applicable. See the Instructions for Form 1040-SS for American Samoa, Guam, the CNMI, the USVI, and Puerto Rico. 

Spouses using the qualified joint venture rules are treated as sole proprietors for federal tax purposes and generally don't need an EIN. If employment taxes are owed by the qualified joint venture, either spouse may report and pay the employment taxes due on the wages paid to the employees using the EIN of that spouse's sole proprietorship. Generally, filing as a qualified joint venture won't increase the spouses' total tax owed on the joint income tax return. However, it gives each spouse credit for social security earnings on which retirement benefits are based and for Medicare coverage without filing a partnership return. 

**Note.** If your spouse is your employee, not your partner, see _One spouse employed by another_ in section 3. For more information on qualified joint ventures, go to _IRS.gov/QJV_ . 

**Exception—Community income.** If you and your spouse wholly own an unincorporated business as community property under the community property laws of a state, foreign country, or U.S. territory, you can treat the business either as a sole proprietorship (of the spouse who carried on the business) or a partnership. You may still make an election to be taxed as a qualified joint venture instead of a partnership. See _Exception—Qualified joint venture_ , earlier in this section. 

## **3. Family Employees** 

**Child employed by parents.** Payments for the services of a child under age 18 who works for their parent in a trade or business aren't subject to social security and Medicare taxes if the trade or business is a sole proprietorship or a partnership in which each partner is a parent of the child. If these payments are for work other than in a trade or business, such as domestic work in the parent's private home, they’re not subject to social security and Medicare taxes until the child reaches age 21. However, see _Covered services of a child or spouse_ , later. Payments for the services of a child under age 21 who works for their parent, whether or not in a trade or business, aren't subject to FUTA tax. Payments for the services of a child of any age who works for their parent are generally subject to income tax withholding unless the payments are for domestic work in the parent's home, or unless the payments are for work other than in a trade or business and are less than $50 in the quarter or the child isn't regularly employed to do such work. 

**One spouse employed by another.** The wages for the services of an individual who works for their spouse in a trade or business are subject to income tax withholding and social security and Medicare taxes, but not to FUTA tax. However, the payments for services of one spouse employed by another in other than a trade or business, such as domestic service in a private home, aren't subject to social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes. 

**Covered services of a child or spouse.** The wages for the services of a child or spouse are subject to income tax withholding as well as social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes if they work for: 

- A corporation, even if it is controlled by the child's parent or the individual's spouse; 

- A partnership, even if the child's parent is a partner, unless each partner is a parent of the child; 

- A partnership, even if the individual's spouse is a partner; or 

- An estate, even if it is the estate of a deceased parent. 

- In these situations, the child or spouse is considered to 

- work for the corporation, partnership, or estate, not you. 

**Parent employed by their child.** When the employer is a child employing their parent, the following rules apply. 

- Payments for the services of a parent in their child’s (the employer’s) trade or business are subject to income tax withholding and social security and Medicare taxes. 

- Payments for the services of a parent not in their child’s (the employer’s) trade or business are generally not subject to social security and Medicare taxes. 

- _Social security and Medicare taxes do apply to_ 

- **!** _payments made to a parent for domestic services if all of the following apply._ 

## **CAUTION** 

- _The parent is employed by their child (the employer)._ 

- _The employer has a child or stepchild (including an adopted child) living in the home._ 

- _The employer is a surviving spouse, divorced and not remarried, or living with a spouse who, because of a mental or physical condition, can't care for their child or stepchild for at least 4 continuous weeks in the calendar quarter in which the service is performed._ 

- _The child or stepchild of the employer is either under age 18 or, due to a mental or physical condition, requires the personal care of an adult for at least 4 continuous weeks in the calendar quarter in which the service is performed._ 

Payments made to a parent employed by their child aren't subject to FUTA tax, regardless of the type of services provided.
