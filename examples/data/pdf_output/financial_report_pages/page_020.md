payments in box 1 of Form W-2 (box 7 of Form 499R-2/ W-2PR). For more information about the tax treatment of differential wage payments, see Revenue Ruling 2009-11, 2009-18 I.R.B. 896, available at _IRS.gov/irb/ 2009-18_IRB#RR-2009-11_ . 

**Fringe benefits.** You must generally include fringe benefits in an employee's wages (but see _Nontaxable fringe benefits_ next). The benefits are subject to income tax withholding and employment taxes. Fringe benefits include cars you provide, flights on aircraft you provide, free or discounted commercial flights, vacations, discounts on property or services, memberships in country clubs or other social clubs, and tickets to entertainment or sporting events. In general, the amount you must include is the amount by which the FMV of the benefit is more than the sum of what the employee paid for it plus any amount the law excludes. There are other special rules you and your employees may use to value certain fringe benefits. See Pub. 15-B for more information. 

_**Nontaxable fringe benefits.**_ Some fringe benefits aren't taxable (or are minimally taxable) if certain conditions are met. See Pub. 15-B for details. The following are some examples of nontaxable fringe benefits. 

- Services provided to your employees at no additional cost to you. 

- Qualified employee discounts. 

- Working condition fringes that are property or services that would be allowable as a business expense or depreciation expense deduction to the employee if they had paid for them. Examples include a company car for business use and subscriptions to business magazines. 

- Certain minimal value fringes (including an occasional cab ride when an employee must work overtime and meals you provide at eating places you run for your employees if the meals aren't furnished at below cost). 

- Qualified transportation fringes subject to specified conditions and dollar limitations (including transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, any transit pass, and qualified parking). 

- The use of on-premises athletic facilities operated by you if substantially all of the use is by employees, their spouses, and their dependent children. 

- Qualified tuition reduction an educational organization provides to its employees for education. For more information, see Pub. 970. 

- Employer-provided cell phones provided primarily for a noncompensatory business reason. 

However, don't exclude the following fringe benefits from the wages of highly compensated employees unless the benefit is available to other employees on a nondiscriminatory basis. 

- No-additional-cost services. 

- Qualified employee discounts. 

- Meals provided at an employer-operated eating facility. 

- Reduced tuition for education. 

For more information, including the definition of a highly compensated employee, see Pub. 15-B. 

_**When taxable fringe benefits are treated as paid.**_ You may choose to treat certain taxable noncash fringe benefits as paid by the pay period, by the quarter, or on any other basis you choose, as long as you treat the benefits as paid at least once a year. You don't have to make a formal choice of payment dates or notify the IRS of the dates you choose. You don't have to make this choice for all employees. You may change methods as often as you like, as long as you treat all benefits provided in a calendar year as paid by December 31 of the calendar year. See section 4 of Pub. 15-B for more information, including a discussion of the special accounting rule for fringe benefits provided during November and December. 

_**Valuation of fringe benefits.**_ Generally, you must determine the value of fringe benefits no later than January 31 of the next year. Before January 31, you may reasonably estimate the value of the fringe benefits for purposes of withholding and depositing on time. 

_**Withholding federal income tax on fringe benefits.**_ You may add the value of fringe benefits to regular wages for a payroll period and figure withholding taxes on the total, or you may withhold federal income tax on the value of the fringe benefits at the optional flat 22% supplemental wage rate. However, see _Withholding on supplemental wages when an employee receives more than $1 million of supplemental wages during the calendar year_ in section 7. 

You may choose not to withhold income tax on the value of an employee's personal use of a vehicle you provide. You must, however, withhold social security and Medicare taxes on the use of the vehicle. See Pub. 15-B for more information on this election. 

_**Withholding social security and Medicare taxes on fringe benefits.**_ You add the value of fringe benefits to regular wages for a payroll period and figure social security and Medicare taxes on the total. 

If you withhold less than the required amount of social security and Medicare taxes from the employee in a calendar year but report and pay the proper amount, you may recover the taxes from the employee. See Pub. 15-B for more information. 

_**Depositing taxes on fringe benefits.**_ Once you choose when fringe benefits are paid, you must deposit taxes in the same deposit period you treat the fringe benefits as paid. To avoid a penalty, deposit the taxes following the general deposit rules for that deposit period. 

If you determine by January 31 you overestimated the value of a fringe benefit at the time you withheld and deposited for it, you may claim a refund for the overpayment or have it applied to your next employment tax return. See _Valuation of fringe benefits_ , earlier in this section. If you underestimated the value and deposited too little, you may be subject to a failure-to-deposit (FTD) penalty. See section 11 for information on deposit penalties.
