## **Wage Repayments** 

If an employee repays you for wages received in error, don't offset the repayments against current year wages unless the repayments are for amounts received in error in the current year. 

**Repayment of current year wages.** If you receive repayments for wages paid during a prior quarter in the current year, report adjustments on Form 941-X to recover income tax withholding and social security and Medicare taxes for the repaid wages. 

**Repayment of prior year wages.** If you receive repayments for wages paid during a prior year, report an adjustment on Form 941-X, Form 943-X, or Form 944-X to recover the social security and Medicare taxes. You can't make an adjustment for income tax withholding because the wages were income to the employee for the prior year. You can't make an adjustment for Additional Medicare Tax withholding because the employee determines liability for Additional Medicare Tax on the employee's income tax return for the prior year. 

You must also file Forms W-2c and W-3c with the SSA to correct social security and Medicare wages and taxes. Don't correct wages (box 1) on Form W-2c for the amount paid in error. Give a copy of Form W-2c to the employee. 

_**Employee reporting of repayment.**_ The wages paid in error in the prior year remain taxable to the employee for that year. This is because the employee received and had use of those funds during that year. The employee isn't entitled to file an amended return (Form 1040-X) to recover the income tax on these wages. Instead, the employee may be entitled to a deduction or credit for the repaid wages on their income tax return for the year of repayment. However, the employee should file an amended return (Form 1040-X) to recover any Additional Medicare Tax paid on the wages paid in error in the prior year. If an employee asks about reporting their wage repayment, you may tell the employee to see _Repayments_ in Pub. 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information. 

## **14. Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax** 

_FUTA tax doesn't apply to employers in American_ **!** _Samoa, Guam, and the CNMI, but it does apply to_ **CAUTION** _employers in the USVI and Puerto Rico._ 

The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), with state unemployment systems, provides for payments of unemployment compensation to workers who have lost their jobs. Most employers pay both a federal and a state unemployment tax. For a list of state unemployment agencies, go to the U.S. Department of Labor’s website at _oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/agencies.asp_ . Only the employer pays FUTA tax; it isn't withheld from the employee's wages. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 940. 

_Services rendered to a federally recognized In-_ **TIP** _dian tribal government (or any subdivision, subsidiary, or business wholly owned by such an Indian tribe) are exempt from FUTA tax, subject to the tribe's compliance with state law. For more information, see section 3309(d) and Pub. 4268._ 

**Who must pay?** Use the following three tests to determine whether you must pay FUTA tax. Each test applies to a different category of employee, and each is independent of the others. If a test describes your situation, you’re subject to FUTA tax on the wages you pay to employees in that category during the current calendar year. 

## 1. **General test.** 

You’re subject to FUTA tax in 2025 on the wages you pay employees who aren't farmworkers or household workers if: 

- a. You paid wages of $1,500 or more in any calendar quarter in 2024 or 2025, or 

- b. You had one or more employees for at least some part of a day in any 20 or more different weeks in 2024 or 20 or more different weeks in 2025. 

## 2. **Household employees test.** 

You’re subject to FUTA tax in 2025 if you paid total cash wages of $1,000 or more to household employees in any calendar quarter in 2024 or 2025. A household employee is an employee who performs household work in a private home, local college club, or local fraternity or sorority chapter. 

## 3. **Farmworkers test.** 

You’re subject to FUTA tax in 2025 on the wages you pay to farmworkers if: 

- a. You paid cash wages of $20,000 or more to farmworkers during any calendar quarter in 2024 or 2025, or 

- b. You employed 10 or more farmworkers during at least some part of a day (whether or not at the same time) during any 20 or more different weeks in 2024 or 20 or more different weeks in 2025. 

To determine whether you meet either test above for farmworkers, you must count wages paid to aliens admitted on a temporary basis to the United States to perform farmwork, also known as H-2A visa workers. However, wages paid to H-2A visa workers aren't subject to the FUTA tax. 

Generally, farmworkers supplied by crew leaders, as defined earlier in section 2, are considered employees of
