more information on paying your taxes with a credit or debit card, go to _IRS.gov/PayByCard_ . 

**Online payment agreement.** You may be eligible to apply for an installment agreement online if you can’t pay the full amount of tax you owe when you file your employment tax return. For more information, see the instructions for your employment tax return or go to _IRS.gov/OPA_ . 

## **Forms in Spanish** 

Many forms and instructions discussed in this publication have Spanish-language versions available for employers and employees. Some examples include Form 941 (sp), Form 944 (sp), Form SS-4 (sp), Form W-4 (sp), and Form W-9 (sp). Although this publication doesn't reference Spanish-language forms and instructions in each instance that one is available, you can see Pub. 15 (sp) and go to _IRS.gov/SpanishForms_ to determine if a Spanish-language version is available. 

## **Hiring New Employees** 

**Eligibility for employment.** You must verify that each new employee is legally eligible to work in the United States, including American Samoa, Guam, the CNMI, the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), and Puerto Rico. This includes completing the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification. You can get Form I-9 at _USCIS.gov/Forms_ . For more information, go to the USCIS website at _USCIS.gov/I-9-Central_ , or call 800-375-5283 or 800-767-1833 (TTY). 

You may use the Social Security Number Verification Service (SSNVS) at _SSA.gov/employer/ssnv.htm_ to verify that an employee name matches an SSN. A person may have a valid SSN but not be authorized to work in the United States. You may use E-Verify at _E-Verify.gov_ to confirm the employment eligibility of newly hired employees. 

**New hire reporting.** All 50 states, and most of the territories, have a new hire registry. You’re required to report any new employee to a designated state new hire registry. A new employee is an employee who hasn't previously been employed by you or was previously employed by you but has been separated from such prior employment for at least 60 consecutive days. 

Many states accept a copy of Form W-4 with employer information added. Go to the Office of Child Support Enforcement website at _acf.hhs.gov/programs/css/employers_ for more information. Employers in American Samoa, Guam, the CNMI, the USVI, and Puerto Rico should contact their local government for information on their new hire registry. 

**W-4 request.** Ask each new employee to complete the 2025 Form W-4. See section 9. 

**Name and social security number (SSN).** Record each new employee's name and SSN from their social security card if it is available. If an employee can't provide their social security card, you should verify their SSN and 

their eligibility for employment as discussed under _Verification of SSNs_ in section 4. Any employee without a social security card should apply for one. See section 4. 

## **Information Returns** 

You must file Forms W-2 to report wages paid to employees. You may also be required to file information returns to report certain types of payments made during the year. For example, you must file Form 1099-NEC, Nonemployee Compensation, to report payments of $600 or more to persons not treated as employees (for example, independent contractors) for services performed for your trade or business. For details about filing Forms 1099 and for information about required electronic filing, see the General Instructions for Certain Information Returns for general information, and the separate, specific instructions for each information return you file (for example, the Instructions for Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC). Generally, don't use Forms 1099 to report wages and other compensation you paid to employees; report these on Form W-2. See the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 for details about filing Form W-2 and for information about required electronic filing. 

**Technical Services Operation (TSO).** The IRS operates the TSO to answer questions about reporting on Forms W-2, W-3, and 1099, and other information returns. If you have questions related to reporting on information returns, call 866-455-7438 (toll free) or 304-263-8700 (toll call). The center can also be reached by email at _mccirp@irs.gov_ . Don't include taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) or attachments in email because email isn't secure. 

## **Federal Income Tax Withholding** 

_References to federal income tax withholding_ **!** _don't apply to employers in American Samoa,_ **CAUTION** _Guam, the CNMI, the USVI, and Puerto Rico, unless you have employees who are subject to U.S. income tax withholding. Contact your local tax department for information about income tax withholding._ 

Withhold federal income tax from each wage payment or supplemental unemployment compensation plan benefit payment according to the employee's Form W-4 and the correct withholding table in Pub. 15-T. Farm operators and crew leaders must withhold federal income tax from the wages of farmworkers if the wages are subject to social security and Medicare taxes. If you're paying supplemental wages to an employee, see section 7. If you have nonresident alien employees, see _Withholding federal income taxes on the wages of nonresident alien employees_ in section 9. 

See section 8 of Pub. 15-A, Employer’s Supplemental Tax Guide, for information about withholding on pensions
