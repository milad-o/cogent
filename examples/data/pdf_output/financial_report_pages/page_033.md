an additional day for each day that is a legal holiday to make the required deposit. For example, if a semiweekly schedule depositor accumulated taxes for payments made on Friday and the following Monday is a legal holiday, the deposit normally due on Wednesday may be made on Thursday (this allows 3 business days to make the deposit). 

**Legal holiday.** The term “legal holiday” means any legal holiday in the District of Columbia. For purposes of the deposit rules, the term “legal holiday” doesn't include other statewide legal holidays. Legal holidays for 2025 are listed next.

## **Application of Monthly and Semiweekly Schedules** 

The terms “monthly schedule depositor” and “semiweekly schedule depositor” don't refer to how often your business pays its employees or even how often you’re required to make deposits. The terms identify which set of deposit rules you must follow when an employment tax liability arises. The deposit rules are based on the dates when wages are paid (cash basis), not on when tax liabilities are accrued for accounting purposes. 

**Monthly schedule example.** Spruce Co. is a monthly schedule depositor with seasonal employees. It paid wages each Friday during March but didn't pay any wages during April. Under the monthly deposit schedule, Spruce Co. must deposit the combined tax liabilities for the March paydays by April 15. Spruce Co. doesn't have a deposit requirement for April (due by May 15) because no wages were paid and, therefore, it didn't have a tax liability for April. 

**Semiweekly schedule example.** Green, Inc., is a semiweekly schedule depositor and pays wages once each month on the last Friday of the month. Although Green, Inc., has a semiweekly deposit schedule, it will deposit just once a month because it pays wages only once a month. The deposit, however, will be made under the semiweekly deposit schedule as follows: Green, Inc.'s tax 

liability for the May 30, 2025 (Friday), payday must be deposited by June 4, 2025 (Wednesday). Under the semiweekly deposit schedule, liabilities for wages paid on Wednesday through Friday must be deposited by the following Wednesday. 

## **$100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule** 

If you accumulate $100,000 or more in taxes on any day during a monthly or semiweekly deposit period (see _Deposit period_ , earlier in this section), you must deposit the tax by the next business day, whether you’re a monthly or semiweekly schedule depositor. 

For purposes of the $100,000 rule, don't continue accumulating a tax liability after the end of a deposit period. For example, if a semiweekly schedule depositor has accumulated a liability of $95,000 on a Tuesday (of a Saturday-through-Tuesday deposit period) and accumulated a $10,000 liability on Wednesday, the $100,000 next-day deposit rule doesn't apply because the $10,000 is accumulated in the next deposit period. Thus, $95,000 must be deposited by Friday and $10,000 must be deposited by the following Wednesday. 

However, once you accumulate at least $100,000 in a deposit period, stop accumulating at the end of that day and begin to accumulate anew on the next day. For example, Fir Co. is a semiweekly schedule depositor. On Monday, Fir Co. accumulates taxes of $110,000 and must deposit this amount on Tuesday, the next business day. On Tuesday, Fir Co. accumulates additional taxes of $30,000. Because the $30,000 isn't added to the previous $110,000 and is less than $100,000, Fir Co. must deposit the $30,000 by Friday (following the semiweekly deposit schedule). 

_If you’re a monthly schedule depositor and accu-_ **!** _mulate a $100,000 tax liability on any day during_ **CAUTION** _the deposit period, you become a semiweekly schedule depositor on the next day and remain so for at least the rest of the calendar year and for the following calendar year._ 

_**Example.**_ Elm, Inc., started its business on May 5, 2025. On Wednesday, May 7, it paid wages for the first time and accumulated a tax liability of $40,000. On Friday, May 9, Elm, Inc., paid wages and accumulated a liability of $60,000, bringing its total accumulated tax liability to $100,000. Because this was the first year of its business, the tax liability for its lookback period is considered to be zero, and it would be a monthly schedule depositor based on the lookback rules. However, since Elm, Inc., accumulated a $100,000 liability on May 9, it became a semiweekly schedule depositor on May 10. It will be a semiweekly schedule depositor for the remainder of 2025 and for 2026. Elm, Inc., is required to deposit the $100,000 by Monday, May 12, the next business day.
