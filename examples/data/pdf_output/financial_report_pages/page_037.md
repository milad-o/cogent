943 by January 31, 2025. However, if you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the year, you may file by February 10, 2025. 

**Form 944.** If you receive written notification that you qualify for the Form 944 program, you must file Form 944 instead of Forms 941. You must file Form 944 even if you have no taxes to report (or you have taxes in excess of $1,000 to report) unless you filed a final return for the prior year. If you received notification to file Form 944, but prefer to file Forms 941, you can request to have your filing requirement changed to Forms 941 during the first calendar quarter of the tax year. For more information on requesting to file Forms 941, including the methods and deadlines for making a request, see the Instructions for Form 944. File your 2024 Form 944 by January 31, 2025. However, if you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the year, you may file by February 10, 2025. 

**Form 945.** If you withhold or are required to withhold federal income tax (including backup withholding) from nonpayroll payments, you must file Form 945. All federal income tax withholding from nonpayroll payments that is reported on Forms 1099 or Form W-2G must be included on Form 945, and not on another form such as Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals. Don't report on Form 945 withholding that is required to be reported on Form 1042, Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons. You don't have to file Form 945 for those years in which you don't have a nonpayroll tax liability. File your 2024 Form 945 by January 31, 2025. However, if you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the year, you may file by February 10, 2025. 

**Exceptions.** The following exceptions apply to the filing requirements for Form 941 and Form 944. 

- **Seasonal employers who don't have to file Forms 941 for quarters when they have no tax liability because they have paid no wages.** To alert the IRS you won't have to file a return for 1 or more quarters during the year, check the “Seasonal employer” box on Form 941, line 18. When you fill out Form 941, be sure to check the box on the top of the form that corresponds to the quarter reported. Generally, the IRS won't inquire about unfiled returns if at least one taxable return is filed each year. However, you must check the “Seasonal employer” box on **every** Form 941 you file. Otherwise, the IRS will expect a return to be filed for each quarter. 

- **Household employers reporting social security and Medicare taxes and/or withheld income tax.** If you file Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944 for business employees, you may include taxes for household employees on your Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944. Otherwise, report social security and Medicare taxes and income tax withholding for household employees on Schedule H (Form 1040). See Pub. 926 for more information. 

- **Agricultural employers reporting social security, Medicare, and withheld income taxes.** Report these taxes on Form 943. 

_Employers that pay Railroad Retirement Tax Act_ **TIP** _(RRTA) taxes use Form CT-1 to report employment taxes imposed by the RRTA, and Form 941 or Form 944 to report federal income taxes withheld from their employees' wages and other compensation._ 

_**E-file**_ **.** The IRS _e-file_ program allows a taxpayer to electronically file Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, and Form 945. For more information, go to _IRS.gov/ EmploymentEfile_ , or call 866-255-0654. 

**Electronic filing by reporting agents.** Reporting agents filing Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 for groups of taxpayers can file them electronically. For details, see Pub. 3112, IRS _e-file_ Application and Participation. For information on electronic filing, see Revenue Procedure 2007-40, 2007-26 I.R.B. 1488, available at _IRS.gov/irb/2007-26_IRB#RP-2007-40_ . For information on the different types of third-party payer arrangements, see section 16. 

**Electronic filing by CPEOs.** With the exception of the first quarter (Form 941 only) for which a CPEO is certified, CPEOs are required to electronically file Form 941 with Schedule R (Form 941), or, if applicable, Form 943 with Schedule R (Form 943). Under certain circumstances, the IRS may waive the electronic filing requirement. To request a waiver, the CPEO must file a written request using the IRS Online Registration System for Professional Employer Organizations at least 45 days before the due date of the return for which the CPEO is unable to electronically file. For more information on filing a waiver request electronically, go to _IRS.gov/CPEO_ . Also see _Revenue Procedure 2023-18_ . 

**Penalties.** For each whole or part month a return isn't filed when required, there is a failure-to-file (FTF) penalty of 5% of the unpaid tax due with that return. The maximum penalty is generally 25% of the tax due. Also, for each whole or part month the tax is paid late, there is a failure-to-pay (FTP) penalty of 0.5% per month of the amount of tax. For individual filers only, the FTP penalty is reduced from 0.5% per month to 0.25% per month if an installment agreement is in effect. You must have filed your return on or before the due date of the return to qualify for the reduced penalty. The maximum amount of the FTP penalty is also 25% of the tax due. If both penalties apply in any month, the FTF penalty is reduced by the amount of the FTP penalty. The penalties won't be charged if you have reasonable cause for failing to file or pay. If you receive a penalty notice, you can provide an explanation of why you believe reasonable cause exists. 

**Note.** In addition to any penalties, interest accrues from the due date of the tax on any unpaid balance.
