of the employee's social security and Medicare taxes is also subject to employee social security and Medicare taxes. This again increases the amount of the additional taxes that you must pay. For more information, see Revenue Ruling 86-14, 1986-1 C.B. 304, and Pub. 15-A. 

_**Household and agricultural employers.**_ If you would rather pay a household or agricultural employee's share of the social security and Medicare taxes without withholding them from the employee’s wages, you may do so. If you don't withhold the taxes, however, you must still pay them on behalf of the employee. Any **employee** social security and Medicare taxes that you pay are additional income to the employee. Include it in box 1 of the employee's Form W-2 (box 7 of Form 499R-2/W-2PR), but don't count it as social security and Medicare wages and don't include it in boxes 3 and 5 (boxes 20 and 22 of Form 499R-2/W-2PR). Also, don't count the additional income as wages for FUTA tax purposes. Different rules apply to employer payments of social security and Medicare taxes for non-household and non-agricultural employees. See section 7 of Pub. 15-A. 

_**Example.**_ Gavrielle operates a small family fruit farm. Gavrielle employs day laborers in the picking season to allow Gavrielle time to get the crops to market. Gavrielle doesn't deduct the employees' share of social security and Medicare taxes from their pay; instead, Gavrielle pays it on their behalf. When Gavrielle prepares the employees' Forms W-2, Gavrielle adds each employee's share of social security and Medicare taxes that Gavrielle paid to the employee's wage income (box 1 of Form W-2), but doesn't include it in box 3 (social security wages) or box 5 (Medicare wages and tips). 

For 2025, Gavrielle paid Dan $1,000 during the year. Gavrielle enters $1,076.50 in box 1 of Dan's Form W-2 ($1,000 wages plus $76.50 social security and Medicare taxes paid for Dan). Gavrielle enters $1,000.00 in boxes 3 and 5 of Dan's Form W-2. 

**Sick pay payments.** Social security and Medicare taxes apply to most payments of sick pay, including payments made by third parties such as insurance companies. For details on third-party payers of sick pay, see Pub. 15-A. 

**Motion picture project employers.** All wages paid by a motion picture project employer to a motion picture project worker during a calendar year are subject to a single social security tax wage base ($176,100 for 2025) and a single FUTA tax wage base ($7,000 for 2025) regardless of the worker's status as a common-law employee of multiple clients of the motion picture project employer. For more information, including the definition of a motion picture project employer and a motion picture project worker, see section 3512. 

**Withholding social security and Medicare taxes on nonresident alien employees.** In general, if you pay wages to nonresident alien employees, you must withhold social security and Medicare taxes as you would for a U.S. citizen or resident alien. However, see Pub. 515 for exceptions to this general rule. One such exception is for foreign 

agricultural workers on H-2A visas, who are exempt from social security and Medicare taxes. See _Compensation paid to H-2A visa holders_ in section 5. 

**International social security agreements.** The United States has social security agreements, also known as totalization agreements, with many countries that eliminate dual social security coverage and taxation. Compensation subject to social security and Medicare taxes may be exempt under one of these agreements. You can get more information and a list of agreement countries from the SSA at _SSA.gov/international_ . Also see Pub. 519. 

**Religious exemption.** An exemption from social security and Medicare taxes is available to members of a recognized religious sect opposed to insurance. This exemption is available only if both the employee and the employer are members of the sect. For more information, see Pub. 517, Social Security and Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers. 

**Foreign persons treated as American employers.** Under section 3121(z), a foreign person who meets both of the following conditions is generally treated as an American employer for purposes of paying FICA taxes on wages paid to an employee who is a U.S. citizen or resident. 

1. The foreign person is a member of a domestically controlled group of entities. 

2. The employee of the foreign person performs services in connection with a contract between the U.S. Government (or an instrumentality of the U.S. Government) and any member of the domestically controlled group of entities. Ownership of more than 50% constitutes control. 

## **Part-Time Workers** 

Part-time workers and workers hired for short periods of time are treated the same as full-time employees for federal income tax withholding and social security, Medicare, and FUTA tax purposes. 

Generally, it doesn't matter whether the part-time worker or worker hired for a short period of time has another job or has the maximum amount of social security tax withheld by another employer. See _Successor employer_ , earlier in this section, for an exception to this rule. 

Income tax withholding may be figured the same way as for full-time workers or it may be figured by the part-year employment method explained in section 6 of Pub. 15-T.
