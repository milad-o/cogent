**Withholding adjustment for nonresident alien employees.** Nonresident aliens may not claim the standard deduction on their tax returns; therefore, employers must add an amount to the wages of nonresident alien employees performing services within the United States in order to figure the amount of federal income tax to withhold from their wages. The amount is added to their wages solely for calculating federal income tax withholding. The amount isn’t included in any box on the employee's Form W-2 and doesn’t increase the income tax liability of the employee. The amount also doesn't increase the social security tax or Medicare tax liability of the employer or the employee, or the FUTA tax liability of the employer. See _Withholding Adjustment for Nonresident Alien Employees_ under _Introduction_ in Pub. 15-T for the amount to add to their wages for the payroll period. 

_**Supplemental wage payment.**_ The adjustment for determining the amount of income tax withholding for nonresident alien employees doesn't apply to a supplemental wage payment (see section 7) if the 37% mandatory flat rate withholding applies or if the 22% optional flat rate withholding is being used to calculate income tax withholding on the supplemental wage payment. 

**Nonresident alien employee's Form W-4.** When completing Forms W-4, nonresident aliens are required to: 

- Not claim exemption from income tax withholding (even if they meet both of the conditions to claim exemption from withholding listed in the Form W-4 instructions); 

- Request withholding as if they’re single, regardless of their actual filing status; 

- Not claim the child tax credit or credit for other dependents in Step 3 of Form W-4 (if the nonresident alien is a resident of Canada, Mexico, or South Korea, or a student from India, or a business apprentice from India, they may claim, under certain circumstances (see Pub. 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens), the child tax credit or credit for other dependents); and 

- Write “Nonresident Alien” or “NRA” in the space below Step 4(c) of Form W-4. 

If you maintain an electronic Form W-4 system, you should provide a field for nonresident aliens to enter nonresident alien status instead of writing “Nonresident Alien” or “NRA” in the space below Step 4(c) of Form W-4. You should instruct nonresident aliens to see Notice 1392, Supplemental Form W-4 Instructions for Nonresident Aliens, before completing Form W-4. 

_**Form 8233.**_ If a nonresident alien employee claims a tax treaty exemption from withholding, the employee must submit Form 8233 with respect to the income exempt under the treaty, instead of Form W-4. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 8233 and _Pay for Personal Services Performed_ under _Withholding on Specific Income_ in Pub. 515. 

**IRS review of requested Forms W-4.** When requested by the IRS, you must make original Forms W-4 available for inspection by an IRS employee. You may also be direc- 

ted to send certain Forms W-4 to the IRS. You may receive a notice from the IRS requiring you to submit a copy of Form W-4 for one or more of your named employees. Send the requested copy or copies of Form W-4 to the IRS at the address provided and in the manner directed by the notice. The IRS may also require you to submit copies of Form W-4 to the IRS as directed by a revenue procedure or notice published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. 

After submitting a copy of a requested Form W-4 to the IRS, continue to withhold federal income tax based on that Form W-4 if it is valid (see _Invalid Forms W-4_ , later in this section). However, if the IRS later notifies you in writing that the employee isn't entitled to claim exemption from withholding or a claimed amount of deductions or credits, withhold federal income tax based on the effective date, employee's permitted filing status, and withholding instructions specified in the IRS notice (commonly referred to as a “lock-in letter”). 

_**Initial lock-in letter.**_ The IRS uses information reported on Form W-2 to identify employees with withholding compliance problems. In some cases, if a serious underwithholding problem is found to exist for a particular employee, the IRS may issue a lock-in letter to the employer specifying the employee's permitted filing status and providing withholding instructions for the specific employee. You’ll also receive a copy for the employee that identifies the permitted filing status and provides a description of the withholding instructions you’re required to follow and the process by which the employee can provide additional information to the IRS for purposes of determining the appropriate withholding and/or modifying the specified filing status. You must furnish the employee copy to the employee within 10 business days of receipt if the employee is employed by you as of the date of the notice. You may follow any reasonable business practice to furnish the employee copy to the employee. Begin withholding based on the notice on the date specified in the notice. 

_**Implementation of lock-in letter.**_ When you receive the notice specifying the permitted filing status and providing withholding instructions, you may not withhold immediately on the basis of the notice. You must begin withholding tax on the basis of the notice for any wages paid after the date specified in the notice. The delay between your receipt of the notice and the date to begin the withholding on the basis of the notice permits the employee time to contact the IRS. 

_**Seasonal employees and employees not currently performing services.**_ If you receive a notice for an employee who isn't currently performing services for you, you’re still required to furnish the employee copy to the employee and withhold based on the notice if any of the following apply. 

- You’re paying wages for the employee's prior services and the wages are subject to income tax withholding on or after the date specified in the notice. 

- You reasonably expect the employee to resume services within 12 months of the date of the notice.
