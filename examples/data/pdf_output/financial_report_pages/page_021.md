If you deposited the required amount of taxes but withheld a lesser amount from the employee, you can recover from the employee the social security, Medicare, or income taxes you deposited on their behalf and included in the employee's Form W-2. However, you must recover the income taxes before April 1 of the following year. 

**Back pay.** Back pay, including retroactive wage increases (but not amounts paid as liquidated damages), is taxed as ordinary wages in the year paid. For information on reporting back pay to the SSA, see Pub. 957. 

**Sick pay.** In general, sick pay is any amount you pay under a plan to an employee who is unable to work because of sickness or injury. These amounts are sometimes paid by a third party, such as an insurance company or an employees' trust. In either case, these payments are subject to social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes. These taxes don't apply to sick pay paid more than 6 calendar months after the last calendar month in which the employee worked for the employer. The payments are always subject to federal income tax. See section 6 of Pub. 15-A for more information. 

**Identity protection services.** The value of identity protection services provided by an employer to an employee isn't included in an employee's gross income and doesn't need to be reported on an information return (such as Form W-2) filed for an employee. This includes identity protection services provided before a data breach occurs. This exception doesn't apply to cash received instead of identity protection services or to proceeds received under an identity theft insurance policy. For more information, see Announcement 2015-22, 2015-35 I.R.B. 288, available at _IRS.gov/irb/2015-35_IRB#ANN-2015-22_ ; and Announcement 2016-02, 2016-3 I.R.B. 283, available at _IRS.gov/irb/2016-03_IRB#ANN-2016-02_ . 

## **6. Tips** 

_You’re permitted to establish a system for elec-_ **TIP** _tronic tip reporting by employees. See Regulations section 31.6053-1(d)._ 

Cash tips your employee receives from customers are generally subject to withholding. Your employee must report cash tips to you by the 10th of the month after the month the tips are received. Cash tips include tips paid by cash, check, debit card, and credit card. The report should include tips you paid over to the employee for charge customers, tips the employee received directly from customers, and tips received from other employees under any tip-sharing arrangement. Both directly and indirectly tipped employees must report tips to you. No report is required for months when tips are less than $20. If you don’t give your employees any specific method to report tips (for example, an electronic tip reporting system), your employees must give you a statement reporting their tips. 

The statement must be signed and dated by the employee and must include: 

- The employee's name, address, and SSN; 

- Your name and address; 

- The month and year (or the beginning and ending dates, if the statement is for a period of less than 1 calendar month) the report covers; and 

- The total of tips received during the month or period. 

You may also suggest that your employees see Pub. 531, Reporting Tip Income. 

**Collecting taxes on tips.** You must collect federal income tax, employee social security tax, and employee Medicare tax on the employee's tips. The withholding rules for withholding an employee's share of Medicare tax on tips also apply to withholding the Additional Medicare Tax once wages and tips exceed $200,000 in the calendar year. 

You can collect these taxes from the employee's wages (excluding tips) or from other funds they make available. See _Tips are treated as supplemental wages_ in section 7 for more information. Stop collecting the employee social security tax when their wages and tips for tax year 2025 reach $176,100; collect the income and employee Medicare taxes for the whole year on all wages and tips. You’re responsible for the employer social security tax on wages and tips until the wages (including tips) reach the limit. You’re responsible for the employer Medicare tax for the whole year on all wages and tips. Tips are considered to be paid at the time the employee reports them to you. Deposit taxes on tips based on your deposit schedule as described in section 11. File Form 941 or Form 944 to report withholding and employment taxes on tips. 

_**Ordering rule.**_ If, by the 10th of the month after the month for which you received an employee's report on tips, you don't have enough employee funds available to deduct the employee tax, you no longer have to collect it. If there aren't enough funds available, withhold taxes in the following order. 

1. Withhold on regular wages and other compensation. 

2. Withhold social security and Medicare taxes on tips. 

3. Withhold income tax on tips. 

**Reporting tips.** Report tips and any collected and uncollected social security and Medicare taxes on Form W-2 (Form 499R-2/W-2PR for employers in Puerto Rico) and on Form 941, lines 5b, 5c, and, if applicable, 5d (Form 944, lines 4b, 4c, and, if applicable, 4d). Report a negative adjustment on Form 941, line 9 (Form 944, line 6), for the uncollected social security and Medicare taxes. Enter the amount of uncollected social security tax and Medicare tax in box 12 of Form W-2 with codes “A” and “B,” respectively. On Form 499R-2/W-2PR, enter the amount of uncollected social security and Medicare taxes in boxes 25 and 26, respectively. Don't include any uncollected Additional Medicare Tax in box 12 of Form W-2.
