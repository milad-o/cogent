_The $100,000 tax liability threshold requiring a_ **TIP** _next-day deposit is determined before you consider any reduction of your liability for nonrefundable credits._ 

## **Accuracy of Deposits Rule** 

You’re required to deposit 100% of your tax liability on or before the deposit due date. However, penalties won't be applied for depositing less than 100% if both of the following conditions are met. 

- Any deposit shortfall doesn't exceed the greater of $100 or 2% of the amount of taxes otherwise required to be deposited. 

- The deposit shortfall is paid or deposited by the shortfall makeup date as described next. 

**Makeup Date for Deposit Shortfall:** 

1. **Monthly schedule depositor.** Deposit the shortfall or pay it with your return by the due date of your return for the return period in which the shortfall occurred. You may pay the shortfall with your return even if the amount is $2,500 or more. 

2. **Semiweekly schedule depositor.** Deposit by the earlier of: 

   - a. The first Wednesday or Friday (whichever comes first) that falls on or after the 15th day of the month following the month in which the shortfall occurred, or 

   - b. The due date of your return (for the return period of the tax liability). 

For example, if a semiweekly schedule depositor has a deposit shortfall during July 2025, the shortfall makeup date is August 15, 2025 (Friday). However, if the shortfall occurred on the required October 1, 2025 (Wednesday), deposit due date for the September 26, 2025 (Friday), pay date, the return due date for the September 26 pay date (October 31, 2025) would come before the November 19, 2025 (Wednesday), shortfall makeup date. In this case, the shortfall must be deposited by October 31, 2025. 

## **How To Deposit** 

You must deposit employment taxes, including Form 945 taxes, by EFT. See _Payment with return_ , earlier in this section, for exceptions explaining when taxes may be paid with the tax return instead of being deposited. 

**Electronic deposit requirement.** You must use EFT to make all federal tax deposits. Generally, an EFT is made using EFTPS. If you don't want to use EFTPS, you can arrange for your tax professional, financial institution, payroll service, or other trusted third party to make electronic deposits on your behalf. EFTPS is a free service provided by the Department of the Treasury. To get more information about EFTPS or to enroll in EFTPS, go to _EFTPS.gov_ or call 800-555-4477, 800-244-4829 (Spanish), or 303-967-5916 (toll call). To contact EFTPS using TRS for 

people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability, dial 711 and then provide the TRS assistant the 800-555-4477 number or 800-733-4829. Additional information about EFTPS is also available in Pub. 966. 

_**When you receive your EIN.**_ If you’re a new employer that indicated a federal tax obligation when requesting an EIN, you’ll be pre-enrolled in EFTPS. You’ll receive information about Express Enrollment in your Employer Identification Number (EIN) Package and an additional mailing containing your EFTPS personal identification number (PIN) and instructions for activating your PIN. Call the toll-free number located in your “How to Activate Your Enrollment” brochure to activate your enrollment and begin making your payroll tax deposits. If you outsource any of your payroll and related tax duties to a third-party payer, such as a payroll service provider (PSP) or reporting agent, be sure to tell them about your EFTPS enrollment. 

_**Deposit record.**_ For your records, an EFT Trace Number will be provided with each successful payment. The number can be used as a receipt or to trace the payment. 

_**Depositing on time.**_ For deposits made by EFTPS to be on time, you must submit the deposit by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date the deposit is due. If you use a third party to make a deposit on your behalf, they may have different cutoff times. 

_**Same-day wire payment option.**_ If you fail to submit a deposit transaction on EFTPS by 8 p.m. Eastern time the day before the date a deposit is due, you can still make your deposit on time by using the Federal Tax Collection Service (FTCS) to make a same-day wire payment. To use the same-day wire payment method, you’ll need to make arrangements with your financial institution ahead of time. Please check with your financial institution regarding availability, deadlines, and costs. Your financial institution may charge you a fee for payments made this way. To learn more about the information you’ll need to give to your financial institution to make a same-day wire payment, go to _IRS.gov/SameDayWire_ . 

**How to claim credit for overpayments.** If you deposited more than the right amount of taxes for a quarter, you can choose on Form 941 for that quarter (or on Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 for that year) to have the overpayment refunded or applied as a credit to your next return. Don't ask EFTPS to request a refund from the IRS for you. 

## **Deposit Penalties** 

_Although the deposit penalties information provi-_ **TIP** _ded next refers specifically to Form 941, these rules also apply to Form 943, Form 944, and Form 945. The penalties won't apply if the employer qualifies for the exceptions to the deposit requirements discussed under_ Payment with return _, earlier in this section)._ 

Penalties may apply if you don't make required deposits on time or if you make deposits for less than the required
