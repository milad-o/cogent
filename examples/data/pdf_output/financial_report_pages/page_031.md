_These rules don't apply to FUTA tax. See section_ **!** _14 for information on depositing FUTA tax._ **CAUTION** 

**Lookback period.** If you’re a Form 941 filer, your deposit schedule for a calendar year is determined from the total taxes reported on Forms 941, line 12, in a 4-quarter lookback period. The lookback period begins July 1 and ends June 30 as shown next in Table 1. If you reported $50,000 or less of taxes for the lookback period, you’re a monthly schedule depositor; if you reported more than $50,000, you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor.

_The lookback period for a 2025 Form 941 filer_ **!** _who filed Form 944 in either 2023 or 2024 is cal-_ **CAUTION** _endar year 2023._ 

If you’re a Form 943 or Form 944 filer for the current year or either of the preceding 2 years, your deposit schedule for a calendar year is determined from the total taxes reported during the second preceding calendar year (either on your Forms 941 for all 4 quarters of that year, your Form 943 for that year, or your Form 944 for that year). The lookback period for 2025 for a Form 943 or Form 944 filer is calendar year 2023. If you reported $50,000 or less of taxes for the lookback period, you’re a monthly schedule depositor; if you reported more than $50,000, you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor. 

If you’re a Form 945 filer, your deposit schedule for a calendar year is determined from the total taxes reported on line 3 of your Form 945 for the second preceding calendar year. The lookback period for 2025 for a Form 945 filer is calendar year 2023. 

_Your total tax liability for the lookback period is de-_ **TIP** _termined based on the amount of taxes you reported on Forms 941, line 12; Form 943, line 13; or Form 944, line 9. Your total liability isn’t reduced by the refundable portion of the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages. For more information about this credit, see the instructions for your employment tax return that were applicable during the lookback period._ 

_**Adjustments and the lookback rule.**_ Adjustments made on Form 941-X, Form 943-X, Form 944-X, and Form 945-X don't affect the amount of tax liability for previous periods for purposes of the lookback rule. 

_**Example.**_ An employer originally reported a tax liability of $45,000 for the lookback period. The employer discovered, during January 2025, that the tax reported for one of the lookback period quarters was understated by $10,000 and corrected this error by filing Form 941-X. This employer is a monthly schedule depositor for 2025 because the lookback period tax liabilities are based on the amounts originally reported, and they were $50,000 or 

less. The $10,000 adjustment is also not treated as part of the 2025 taxes. 

**Deposit period.** The term “deposit period” refers to the period during which tax liabilities are accumulated for each required deposit due date. For monthly schedule depositors, the deposit period is a calendar month. The deposit periods for semiweekly schedule depositors are Wednesday through Friday and Saturday through Tuesday. 

_If you're an agent with an approved Form 2678,_ **TIP** _the deposit rules apply to you based on the total employment taxes accumulated by you for your own employees and on behalf of all employers for whom you're authorized to act. For more information on an agent with an approved Form 2678, see Revenue Procedure 2013-39, 2013-52 I.R.B. 830, available at IRS.gov/irb/ 2013-52_IRB#RP-2013-39._ 

## **Monthly Deposit Schedule** 

For Form 941 filers, you're a monthly schedule depositor for a calendar year if the total taxes on Forms 941, line 12, for the 4 quarters in your lookback period were $50,000 or less. For Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 filers, you're a monthly schedule depositor for a calendar year if the total taxes on Form 943, line 13; Form 944, line 9; or Form 945, line 3, during your lookback period were $50,000 or less. Under the monthly deposit schedule, deposit employment taxes on payments made during a month by the 15th day _-_ of the following month.

Monthly schedule depositors shouldn't file Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 on a monthly basis. 

**New employers.** For Form 941 filers, your tax liability for any quarter in the lookback period before you started or acquired your business is considered to be zero. Therefore, you’re a monthly schedule depositor for the first calendar year of your business. For Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 filers, your tax liability in the lookback period before you started or acquired your business is considered to be zero. Therefore, you're a monthly schedule depositor for the first and second calendar years of your business. However, see _$100,000 Next-Day Deposit Rule_ , later in this section. 

## **Semiweekly Deposit Schedule**
