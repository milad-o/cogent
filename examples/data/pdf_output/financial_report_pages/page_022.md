in Puerto Rico, see the Instructions for Form W-3 (PR) and Form W-3C (PR). 

Revenue Ruling 2012-18 provides guidance for employers regarding social security and Medicare taxes imposed on tips, including information on the reporting of the employer share of social security and Medicare taxes under section 3121(q), the difference between tips and service charges, and the section 45B credit. See Revenue Ruling 2012-18, 2012-26 I.R.B. 1032, available at _IRS.gov/irb/2012-26_IRB#RR-2012-18_ . 

**FUTA tax on tips.** If an employee reports to you in writing $20 or more of tips in a month, the tips are also subject to FUTA tax. 

**Allocated tips.** If you operate a large food or beverage establishment, you must report allocated tips under certain circumstances. However, don't withhold income, social security, or Medicare taxes on allocated tips. 

A large food or beverage establishment is one that is located in the 50 states or the District of Columbia, provides food or beverages for consumption on the premises, where tipping is customary, and where there were normally more than 10 employees on a typical business day during the preceding year. 

The tips may be allocated by one of three methods—hours worked, gross receipts, or good faith agreement. For information about these allocation methods, and for information about required electronic filing of Form 8027, see the Instructions for Form 8027. For more information on filing Form 8027 electronically with the IRS, see Pub. 1239. 

**Tip Rate Determination and Education Program.** Employers may participate in the Tip Rate Determination and Education Program. The program primarily consists of two voluntary agreements developed to improve tip income reporting by helping taxpayers to understand and meet their tip reporting responsibilities. The two agreements are the Tip Rate Determination Agreement (TRDA) and the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (TRAC). A tip agreement, the Gaming Industry Tip Compliance Agreement (GITCA), is available for the gaming (casino) industry. For more information, see Pub. 3144. 

**More information.** Advise your employees to see Pub. 531 or use the IRS Interactive Tax Assistant at _IRS.gov/ TipIncome_ for help in determining if their tip income is taxable and for information about how to report tip income. 

## **7. Supplemental Wages** 

_References to federal income tax withholding_ **!** _don't apply to employers in American Samoa,_ **CAUTION** _Guam, the CNMI, the USVI, and Puerto Rico, unless you have employees who are subject to U.S. income tax withholding. Contact your local tax department for information about income tax withholding._ 

Supplemental wages are wage payments to an employee that aren't regular wages. They include, but aren't 

limited to, bonuses, commissions, overtime pay, payments for accumulated sick leave, severance pay, awards, prizes, back pay, reported tips, retroactive pay increases, and payments for nondeductible moving expenses. However, employers have the option to treat overtime pay and tips as regular wages instead of supplemental wages. Other payments subject to the supplemental wage rules include taxable fringe benefits and expense allowances paid under a nonaccountable plan. How you withhold on supplemental wages depends on whether the supplemental payment is identified as a separate payment from regular wages. See Regulations section 31.3402(g)-1 for additional guidance. Also see Revenue Ruling 2008-29, 2008-24 I.R.B. 1149, available at _IRS.gov/irb/ 2008-24_IRB#RR-2008-29_ . 

**Withholding on supplemental wages when an employee receives more than $1 million of supplemental wages from you during the calendar year.** Special rules apply to the extent supplemental wages paid to any one employee during the calendar year exceed $1 million. If a supplemental wage payment, together with other supplemental wage payments made to the employee during the calendar year, exceeds $1 million, the excess is subject to withholding at 37% (or the highest rate of income tax for the year). Withhold using the 37% rate without regard to the employee's Form W-4. In determining supplemental wages paid to the employee during the year, include payments from all businesses under common control. For more information, see Treasury Decision 9276, 2006-37 I.R.B. 423, available at _IRS.gov/irb/ 2006-37_IRB#TD-9276_ . 

**Withholding on supplemental wage payments to an employee who doesn't receive $1 million of supplemental wages during the calendar year.** If the supplemental wages paid to the employee during the calendar year are less than or equal to $1 million, the following rules apply in determining the amount of income tax to be withheld. 

**Supplemental wages combined with regular wages.** If you pay supplemental wages with regular wages but don't specify the amount of each, withhold federal income tax as if the total were a single payment for a regular payroll period. 

**Supplemental wages identified separately from regular wages.** If you pay supplemental wages separately (or combine them in a single payment and specify the amount of each), the federal income tax withholding method depends partly on whether you withhold income tax from your employee's regular wages. 

1. If you withheld income tax from an employee's regular wages in the current or immediately preceding calendar year, you can use one of the following methods for the supplemental wages. 

   - a. Withhold a flat 22% (no other percentage allowed). 

   - b. If the supplemental wages are paid concurrently with regular wages, add the supplemental wages
