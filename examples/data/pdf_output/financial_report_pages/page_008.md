## **Filing Addresses** 

Generally, your filing address for Form 940, Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, Form 945, or Form CT-1 depends on the location of your residence or principal place of business and whether or not you’re including a payment with your return.

See the separate instructions for Form 940, Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, Form 945, or Form CT-1 for the filing addresses. 

## **Private Delivery Services (PDSs)**
