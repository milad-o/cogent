the farm operator) workers to do farmwork for the farm operator. If there is no written agreement between you and the farm operator stating that you're their employee and if you pay the workers (either for yourself or for the farm operator), then you're a crew leader. For FUTA tax rules, see section 14. 

If you're a crew leader, you're not considered the employee of the farm operator for services you perform in furnishing farmworkers and as a member of the crew. 

_**H-2A agricultural workers.**_ On Form W-2, don't check box 13 (Statutory employee), as H-2A workers aren't statutory employees. 

**Treating employees as nonemployees.** You’ll generally be liable for social security and Medicare taxes and withheld income tax if you don't deduct and withhold these taxes because you treated an employee as a nonemployee. You may be able to figure your liability using special section 3509 rates for the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes and federal income tax withholding. The applicable rates depend on whether you filed required Forms 1099. You can't recover the employee share of social security tax, Medicare tax, or income tax withholding from the employee if the tax is paid under section 3509. You’re liable for the income tax withholding regardless of whether the employee paid income tax on the wages. You continue to owe the full employer share of social security and Medicare taxes. The employee remains liable for the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes. See section 3509 for details. Also see the Instructions for Form 941-X, the Instructions for Form 943-X, or the Instructions for Form 944-X. 

Section 3509 rates aren't available if you intentionally disregard the requirement to withhold taxes from the employee or if you withheld income taxes but not social security or Medicare taxes. Section 3509 isn't available for _-_ reclassifying statutory employees. See _Statutory employ ees_ , earlier in this section. 

If the employer issued required information returns, the section 3509 rates are the following. 

- For social security taxes: employer rate of 6.2% plus 20% of the employee rate of 6.2%, for a total rate of 7.44% of wages. 

- For Medicare taxes: employer rate of 1.45% plus 20% of the employee rate of 1.45%, for a total rate of 1.74% of wages. 

- For Additional Medicare Tax: 0.18% (20% of the employee rate of 0.9%) of wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax. 

- For federal income tax withholding, the rate is 1.5% of wages. 

If the employer didn't issue required information returns, the section 3509 rates are the following. 

- For social security taxes: employer rate of 6.2% plus 40% of the employee rate of 6.2%, for a total rate of 8.68% of wages. 

- For Medicare taxes: employer rate of 1.45% plus 40% of the employee rate of 1.45%, for a total rate of 2.03% of wages. 

- For Additional Medicare Tax: 0.36% (40% of the employee rate of 0.9%) of wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax. 

- For federal income tax withholding, the rate is 3.0% of wages. 

_**Relief provisions.**_ If you have a reasonable basis for not treating a worker as an employee, you may be relieved from having to pay employment taxes for that worker. To get this relief, you must file all required federal tax returns, including information returns, on a basis consistent with your treatment of the worker. You (or your predecessor) must not have treated any worker holding a substantially similar position as an employee for any periods beginning after 1977. See Pub. 1976, Do You Qualify for Relief Under Section 530. 

**IRS help.** If you want the IRS to determine whether a worker is an employee, file Form SS-8. 

**Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (VCSP).** Employers who are currently treating their workers (or a class or group of workers) as independent contractors or other nonemployees and want to voluntarily reclassify their workers as employees for future tax periods may be eligible to participate in the VCSP if certain requirements are met. File Form 8952 to apply for the VCSP. For more information, go to _IRS.gov/VCSP_ . 

## **Business Owned and Operated by Spouses** 

If you and your spouse jointly own and operate a business and share in the profits and losses, you may be partners in a partnership, whether or not you have a formal partnership agreement. See Pub. 541 for more details. The partnership is considered the employer of any employees, and is liable for any employment taxes due on wages paid to its employees. 

**Exception—Qualified joint venture.** For tax years beginning after 2006, the Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-28) provides that a “qualified joint venture,” whose only members are spouses filing a joint income tax return, can elect not to be treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes. A qualified joint venture conducts a trade or business where: 

- The only members of the joint venture are spouses who file a joint income tax return, 

- Both spouses materially participate (see _Material participation_ in the instructions for Schedule C (Form 1040), line G) in the trade or business (mere joint ownership of property isn't enough), 

- Both spouses elect to not be treated as a partnership, and
