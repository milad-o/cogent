hospital insurance part is financed by the Medicare tax. Each of these taxes is reported separately. 

Generally, you’re required to withhold social security and Medicare taxes from your employees' wages and pay the employer share of these taxes. Certain types of wages and compensation aren't subject to social security and Medicare taxes. See section 5 and section 15 for details. Generally, employee wages are subject to social security and Medicare taxes regardless of the employee's age or whether they are receiving social security benefits. If the employee reported tips, see section 6. 

**The $150 test or the $2,500 test for farmwork.** All cash wages that you pay to an employee during the year for farmwork are subject to social security and Medicare taxes and federal income tax withholding if either of the two tests below is met. 

- You pay cash wages to an employee of $150 or more in a year for farmwork (count all cash wages paid on a time, piecework, or other basis). The $150 test applies separately to each farmworker that you employ. If you employ a family of workers, each member is treated separately. Don't count wages paid by other employers. 

- The total that you pay for farmwork (cash and noncash) to all your employees is $2,500 or more during the year. 

_**Exceptions.**_ Annual cash wages of less than $150 you pay to a **seasonal** farmworker aren't subject to social security and Medicare taxes, or federal income tax withholding, even if you pay $2,500 or more to all your farmworkers. However, these wages count toward the $2,500 test for determining whether other farmworkers' wages are subject to social security and Medicare taxes. 

- A seasonal farmworker is a worker who: 

- Is employed in agriculture as a hand-harvest laborer, 

- Is paid piece rates in an operation that is usually paid on a piece-rate basis in the region of employment, 

- Commutes daily from their permanent home to the farm, and 

- Had been employed in agriculture less than 13 weeks in the preceding calendar year. 

Wages paid to a child under 18 working on a farm that is a sole proprietorship or a partnership in which each partner is a parent of a child aren't subject to social security and Medicare taxes. However, these wages count toward the $2,500 test for determining whether other farmworkers' wages are subject to social security and Medicare taxes. 

_**Deducting the tax.**_ Deduct the employee tax from each wage payment. If you’re not sure that the wages that you pay to a farmworker during the year will be taxable, you may either deduct the tax when you make the payments or wait until the $2,500 test or the $150 test discussed earlier has been met. 

**Tax rates and the social security wage base limit.** Social security and Medicare taxes have different rates and 

only the social security tax has a wage base limit. The wage base limit is the maximum wage subject to the tax for the year. Determine the amount of withholding for social security and Medicare taxes by multiplying each payment by the employee tax rate. 

For 2025, the social security tax rate is 6.2% (amount withheld) each for the employer and employee (12.4% total). The social security wage base limit is $176,100. The tax rate for Medicare is 1.45% (amount withheld) each for the employee and employer (2.9% total). There is no wage base limit for Medicare tax; all covered wages are subject to Medicare tax. 

**Additional Medicare Tax withholding.** In addition to withholding Medicare tax at 1.45%, you must withhold a 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax from wages you pay to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. You’re required to begin withholding Additional Medicare Tax in the pay period in which you pay wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each pay period until the end of the calendar year. Additional Medicare Tax is only imposed on the employee. There is no employer share of Additional Medicare Tax. All wages that are subject to Medicare tax are subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding if paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding threshold. 

For more information on what wages are subject to Medicare tax, see section 15. For more information on Additional Medicare Tax, go to _IRS.gov/ADMTfaqs_ . 

**Successor employer.** When corporate acquisitions meet certain requirements, wages paid by the predecessor are treated as if paid by the successor for purposes of applying the social security wage base and for applying the Additional Medicare Tax withholding threshold (that is, $200,000 in a calendar year). You should determine whether or not you should file Schedule D (Form 941), Report of Discrepancies Caused by Acquisitions, Statutory Mergers, or Consolidations, by reviewing the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941). See Regulations section 31.3121(a)(1)-1(b) for more information. Also see Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-34 I.R.B. 320, available at _IRS.gov/irb/2004-34_IRB#RP-2004-53_ . 

_**Example.**_ Early in 2025, you bought all of the assets of a plumbing business from Adam Black. Julian Gold, who had been employed by Adam and received $2,000 in wages before the date of purchase, continued to work for you. The wages you paid to Julian are subject to social security tax on the first $174,100 ($176,100 minus $2,000). Medicare tax is due on all of the wages you pay Julian during the calendar year. You should include the $2,000 Julian received while employed by Adam in determining whether Julian's wages exceed the $200,000 for Additional Medicare Tax withholding threshold. 

**Employee's portion of taxes paid by employer.** If you pay your employee's social security and Medicare taxes without deducting them from the employee's pay, you must include the amount of the payments in the employee's wages for social security and Medicare taxes. This increase in the employee's wage payment for your payment
