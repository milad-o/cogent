|**IF the payday falls on a...**|**THEN deposit taxes by the**<br>**following...**|
|---|---|
|Wednesday, Thursday, and/or<br>Friday|Wednesday.|
|Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and/or<br>Tuesday|Friday.|



**Semiweekly deposit period spanning 2 quarters (Form 941 filers).** If you have more than 1 pay date during a semiweekly period and the pay dates fall in different calendar quarters, you’ll need to make **separate deposits** for the separate liabilities. 

_**Example.**_ If you have a pay date on Saturday, March 29, 2025 (first quarter), and another pay date on Tuesday, April 1, 2025 (second quarter), two separate deposits would be required even though the pay dates fall within the same semiweekly period. Both deposits would be due on Friday, April 4, 2025. 

**Semiweekly deposit period spanning 2 return periods (Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 filers).** The period covered by a return is the return period. The return period for annual Form 943, Form 944, and Form 945 is a calendar year. If you have more than 1 pay date during a semiweekly period and the pay dates fall in different return periods, you'll need to make separate deposits for the separate liabilities. For example, if a return period ends on Thursday, taxes accumulated on Wednesday and Thursday are subject to one deposit obligation, and taxes accumulated on Friday are subject to a separate obligation. Separate deposits are required because 2 different return periods are affected.

## **Example of Monthly and Semiweekly Schedules** 

Rose Co. reported Form 941 taxes as follows. 

|**2024 Lookback Period**|**2024 Lookback Period**|**2025 Lookback Period**|**2025 Lookback Period**|
|---|---|---|---|
|3rd Quarter 2022<br>4th Quarter 2022<br>1st Quarter 2023<br>2nd Quarter 2023|$12,000<br> 12,000<br> 12,000<br> 12,000<br> $48,000|3rd Quarter 2023<br>4th Quarter 2023<br>1st Quarter 2024<br>2nd Quarter 2024|$12,000<br> 12,000<br> 12,000<br>15,000<br> $51,000|



Rose Co. is a monthly schedule depositor for 2024 because its tax liability for the 4 quarters in its lookback period (third quarter 2022 through second quarter 2023) wasn't more than $50,000. However, for 2025, Rose Co. will be a semiweekly schedule depositor because the total taxes exceeded $50,000 for the 4 quarters in its lookback period (third quarter 2023 through second quarter 2024). 

**Example for employers of farmworkers.** Red Co. reported taxes on its 2023 Form 943, line 13, of $48,000. On its 2024 Form 943, line 13, it reported taxes of $60,000. 

Red Co. is a monthly schedule depositor for 2025 because its taxes for its lookback period ($48,000 for calendar year 2023) weren't more than $50,000. However, for 2026, Red Co. is a semiweekly schedule depositor because the total taxes for its lookback period ($60,000 for calendar year 2024) exceeded $50,000. 

## **Deposits Due on Business Days Only** 

If a deposit is required to be made on a day that isn't a business day, the deposit is considered timely if it is made by the close of the next business day. A business day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For example, if a deposit is required to be made on a Friday and Friday is a legal holiday, the deposit will be considered timely if it is made by the following Monday (if that Monday is a business day). 

**Semiweekly schedule depositors** have at least 3 business days following the close of the semiweekly period to make a deposit. If any of the 3 weekdays after the end of a semiweekly period is a legal holiday, you’ll have
