line 13; Form 944, line 9; or Form 945, line 3, equaled or exceeded $2,500 and you: 

- Completed Form 941, line 16, instead of Schedule B (Form 941); Form 943, line 17, instead of Form 943-A; Form 944, line 13, instead of Form 945-A; or Form 945, line 7, instead of Form 945-A; 

- Failed to attach a properly completed Schedule B (Form 941); Form 943-A, or Form 945-A, as applicable; or 

- Improperly completed Schedule B (Form 941), Form 943-A, or Form 945-A by, for example, entering tax deposits instead of tax liabilities in the numbered spaces. 

The FTD penalty is figured by distributing your total tax liability shown on Form 941, line 12; Form 943, line 13; Form 944, line 9; or Form 945, line 3, equally throughout the tax period. Then we apply your deposits and payments to the averaged liabilities in the date order we received your deposits. We figure the penalty on any tax not deposited, deposited late, or not deposited in the correct amounts. Your deposits and payments may not be counted as timely because the actual dates of your tax liabilities can't be accurately determined. 

You can avoid an "averaged" FTD penalty by reviewing your return before you file it. Follow these steps before submitting your Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945. 

- If you’re a monthly schedule depositor, report your tax liabilities (not your deposits) in the monthly entry spaces on Form 941, line 16; Form 943, line 17; Form 944, line 13; or Form 945, line 7. 

- If you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor, report your tax liabilities (not your deposits) on Schedule B (Form 941), Form 943-A, or Form 945-A, as applicable, on the lines that represent the dates your employees were paid. 

- Verify that your total liability shown on Form 941, line 16, or the bottom of Schedule B (Form 941) equals your tax liability shown on Form 941, line 12. 

- Verify that your total liability shown on Form 943, line 17, or Form 943-A, line M, equals your tax liability shown on Form 943, line 13. 

- Verify that your total liability shown on Form 944, line 13, or Form 945-A, line M, equals your tax liability shown on Form 944, line 9. 

- Verify that your total liability shown on Form 945, line 7, or Form 945-A, line M, equals your tax liability shown on Form 945, line 3. 

- Don't show negative amounts on Form 941, line 16, or Schedule B (Form 941); Form 943, line 17, or Form 943-A; Form 944, line 13, or Form 945-A; or Form 945, line 7, or Form 945-A. 

- For prior period errors, don't adjust your tax liabilities reported on Form 941, line 16, or Schedule B (Form 941); Form 943, line 17, or Form 943-A; Form 944, line 13, or Form 945-A; or Form 945, line 7, or Form 

945-A. Instead, file an adjusted return (Form 941-X, 943-X, 944-X, or 945-X) if you’re also adjusting your tax liability. If you’re only adjusting your deposits in response to an FTD penalty notice, see the Instructions for Schedule B (Form 941), the Instructions for Form 943-A (for Form 943), or the Instructions for Form 945-A (for Forms 944 and 945).

## **12. Filing Forms 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945** 

**Form 941.** If you paid wages subject to federal income tax withholding (including withholding on sick pay and supplemental unemployment benefits) or social security and Medicare taxes, you must file Form 941 quarterly even if you have no taxes to report, unless you filed a final return, you receive an IRS notification that you’re eligible to file Form 944, or the exceptions discussed later apply. Also, if you’re required to file Forms 941 but believe your employment taxes for the calendar year will be $1,000 or less, and you would like to file Form 944 instead of Forms 941, you must contact the IRS during the first calendar quarter of the tax year to request to file Form 944. You must receive written notice from the IRS to file Form 944 instead of Forms 941 before you may file this form. For more information on requesting to file Form 944, including the methods and deadlines for making a request, see the Instructions for Form 944. Form 941 must be filed by the last day of the month that follows the end of the quarter. However, if you made timely deposits in full payment of your taxes for the quarter, you may file by the 10th day of the 2nd month that follows the end of the quarter. See _Calendar_ , earlier. 

**Form 943.** You must file Form 943 for each calendar year beginning with the first year that you pay $2,500 or more for farmwork or you employ a farmworker who meets _-_ the $150 test explained under _Social Security and Medi care Taxes_ , in section 9. Don’t report these wages on Form 941, Form 944, or Form 945. File your 2024 Form
