Form W-3 (PR), “Other EIN used this year” is reported in box f. 

8. Be sure the amounts on Form W-3 are the total of amounts from Forms W-2. 

9. Reconcile Form W-3 with your four quarterly Forms 941, annual Form 943, or annual Form 944 by comparing amounts reported for the following items. 

   - a. Federal income tax withheld. 

   - b. Social security and Medicare wages. 

   - c. Social security and Medicare taxes. Generally, the amounts shown on Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944, including current year adjustments, should be approximately twice the amounts shown on Form W-3 because Forms 941, Form 943, and Form 944 report both the employer and employee social security and Medicare taxes while Form W-3 reports only the employee taxes. 

Don't report backup withholding or withholding on nonpayroll payments, such as pensions, annuities, and gambling winnings, on Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944. Withholding on nonpayroll payments is reported on Forms 1099 or W-2G and must be reported on Form 945. Only taxes and withholding reported on Form W-2 should be reported on Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944. 

Amounts reported on Forms W-2, W-3, and Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944 may not match for valid reasons. For example, if you withheld any Additional Medicare Tax from your employee’s wages, the amount of Medicare tax that is reported on Forms 941, line 5c, column 2; Form 943, line 5; or Form 944, line 4c, column 2, won’t be twice the amount of the Medicare tax withheld that is reported in box 6 of Form W-3 (box 13 of Form W-3 (PR)) because the Additional Medicare Tax is only imposed on the employee; there is no employer share of Additional Medicare Tax. Make sure there are valid reasons for any mismatch. Keep your reconciliation so you’ll have a record of why amounts didn't match in case there are inquiries from the IRS or the SSA. See the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 941) if you need to explain any discrepancies that were caused by an acquisition, statutory merger, or consolidation. 

## **13. Reporting Adjustments to Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944** 

## **Current Period Adjustments** 

In certain cases, amounts reported as social security and Medicare taxes on Form 941, lines 5a–5d, column 2 (Form 943, lines 3, 5, and 7; or Form 944, lines 4a–4d, column 2), must be adjusted to arrive at your correct tax liability (for example, excluding amounts withheld by a third-party payer or amounts you weren't required to withhold). Current period adjustments are reported on Form 941, lines 

7–9; Form 943, line 10; or Form 944, line 6, and include the following types of adjustments. 

**Fractions-of-cents adjustment.** If there is a small difference between total taxes after adjustments and nonrefundable credits (Form 941, line 12; Form 943, line 13; or Form 944, line 9) and total deposits (Form 941, line 13; Form 943, line 14; or Form 944, line 10), it may have been caused, all or in part, by rounding to the nearest cent each time you figured payroll. This rounding occurs when you figure the amount of social security and Medicare tax to be withheld and deposited from each employee's wages. The IRS refers to rounding differences relating to employee withholding of social security and Medicare taxes as “fractions-of-cents” adjustments. If you pay your taxes with Form 941 (or Form 943 or Form 944) instead of making deposits because your total taxes for the quarter (year for Form 943 or Form 944) are less than $2,500, you may also report a fractions-of-cents adjustment. 

To determine if you have a fractions-of-cents adjustment for 2025, multiply the total wages and tips for the quarter subject to: 

- Social security tax reported on Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944 by 6.2% (0.062); 

- Medicare tax reported on Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944 by 1.45% (0.0145); and 

- Additional Medicare Tax reported on Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944 by 0.9% (0.009). 

Compare these amounts (the employee share of social security and Medicare taxes) with the total social security and Medicare taxes actually withheld from employees and shown in your payroll records for the quarter (Form 941) or the year (Form 943 or Form 944). If there is a small difference, the amount, positive or negative, may be a fractions-of-cents adjustment. Fractions-of-cents adjustments are reported on Form 941, line 7; Form 943, line 10; or Form 944, line 6. If the actual amount withheld is less, report a negative adjustment using a minus sign (if possible; otherwise, use parentheses) in the entry space. If the actual amount is more, report a positive adjustment. 

**Adjustment of tax on third-party sick pay.** Report both the employer and employee share of social security and Medicare taxes for sick pay on Form 941, lines 5a and 5c (or Form 943, lines 2 and 4; or Form 944, lines 4a and 4c). If the aggregate wages paid for an employee by the employer and third-party payer exceed $200,000 for the calendar year, report the Additional Medicare Tax on Form 941, line 5d (Form 943, line 7; or Form 944, line 4d). Show as a negative adjustment on Form 941, line 8 (or Form 943, line 10; or Form 944, line 6), the social security and Medicare taxes withheld on sick pay by a third-party payer. See section 6 of Pub. 15-A for more information. 

**Adjustment of tax on tips.** If, by the 10th of the month after the month you received an employee's report on tips, you don't have enough employee funds available to withhold the employee's share of social security and Medicare taxes, you no longer have to collect it. However, report the entire amount of these tips on Form 941, lines 5b and 5c
