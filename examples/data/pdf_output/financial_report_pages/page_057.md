Below is a message to you from the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization established by Congress. 

## **The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) Is Here To Help You** 

## **What Is the Taxpayer Advocate Service?** 

The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is an independent organization within the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). TAS helps taxpayers resolve problems with the IRS, makes administrative and legislative recommendations to prevent or correct the problems, and protects taxpayer rights. We work to ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and that you know and understand your rights under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. We are Your Voice at the IRS. 

## **How Can TAS Help Me?** 

TAS can help you resolve problems that you haven’t been able to resolve with the IRS on your own. Always try to resolve your problem with the IRS first, but if you can’t, then come to TAS. Our services are free. 

- TAS helps all taxpayers (and their representatives), including individuals, businesses, and exempt organizations. You may be eligible for TAS help if your IRS problem is causing financial difficulty, if you’ve tried and been unable to resolve your issue with the IRS, or if you believe an IRS system, process, or procedure just isn't working as it should. 

- To get help any time with general tax topics, visit _www.TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov_ . The site can help you with common tax issues and situations, such as what to do if you make a mistake on your return or if you get a notice from the IRS. 

- TAS works to resolve large-scale (systemic) problems that affect many taxpayers. You can report systemic issues at _www.IRS.gov/SAMS_ . (Be sure not to include any personal identifiable information.)

Go to _www.TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov/Taxpayer-Rights_ for more information about the rights, what they mean to you, and how they apply to specific situations you may encounter with the IRS.
