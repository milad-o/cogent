wages, you should have a Form W-4 on file for each employee. Encourage your employees to file an updated Form W-4 for 2025, especially if they owed taxes or received a large refund when filing their 2024 tax return. 

Ask all new employees to give you a signed Form W-4 when they start work. Make the form effective with the first wage payment. If a new employee doesn't give you a completed Form W-4 in 2025 (including an employee who previously worked for you and was rehired in 2025, and who fails to furnish a Form W-4), treat the new employee as if they had checked the box for Single or Married filing separately in Step 1(c) and made no entries in Step 2, Step 3, or Step 4 of the 2025 Form W-4. An employee who was paid wages before 2020 and who failed to furnish a Form W-4 should continue to be treated as single and claiming zero allowances on a 2019 Form W-4. If you use the optional computational bridge, described earlier under _Redesigned Form W-4_ , you may treat this employee as if they had checked the box for Single or Married filing separately in Step 1(c), and made no entries in Step 2 and Step 3, an entry of $8,600 in Step 4(a), and an entry of zero in Step 4(b) of the 2025 Form W-4. 

_**Electronic system to receive Form W-4.**_ You may establish a system to electronically receive Forms W-4 from your employees. See Regulations section 31.3402(f) (5)-1(c) and Pub. 15-T for more information. 

_**Effective date of Form W-4.**_ A Form W-4 for 2024 or earlier years remains in effect for 2025 unless the employee gives you a 2025 Form W-4. When you receive a new Form W-4 from an employee, don't adjust withholding for pay periods before the effective date of the new form. If an employee gives you a Form W-4 that replaces an existing Form W-4, begin withholding no later than the start of the first payroll period ending on or after the 30th day from the date when you received the replacement Form W-4. For exceptions, see _Exemption from federal income tax withholding_ , _IRS review of requested Forms W-4_ , and _Invalid Forms W-4_ , later in this section.

_**Successor employer.**_ If you’re a successor employer (see _Successor employer_ , later in this section), secure new Forms W-4 from the transferred employees unless the “Alternative Procedure” in section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53 applies. See Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-34 I.R.B. 320, available at _IRS.gov/irb/ 2004-34_IRB#RP-2004-53_ . 

_You may advise your employees to use the IRS_ **TIP** _Tax Withholding Estimator available at IRS.gov/ W4App for help in determining how to complete their Forms W-4. An employee that makes a mid-year change to their withholding after using the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator may be underwithheld or overwithheld once their Form W-4 is applied to the next full calendar year. Therefore, you should remind employees that made_ 

_a mid-year change to revisit the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator in early January and submit a new Form W-4 for the year._ 

_**Completing Form W-4.**_ The amount of any federal income tax withholding must be based on filing status, income (including income from other jobs), deductions, and credits. Your employees may not base their withholding amounts on a fixed dollar amount or percentage. However, an employee may specify a dollar amount to be withheld each pay period in addition to the amount of withholding based on filing status and other information reported on Form W-4. 

Employees that are married filing jointly and have spouses that also currently work, or employees that hold more than one job at the same time, should account for their higher tax rate by completing Step 2 of their 2025 Form W-4. Employees also have the option to report on their 2025 Form W-4 other income they will receive that isn't subject to withholding and other deductions they will claim in order to increase the accuracy of their federal income tax withholding. 

See Pub. 505 for more information about completing Form W-4. Along with Form W-4, you may wish to order Pub. 505 for use by your employees. 

Don't accept any withholding or estimated tax payments from your employees in addition to withholding based on their Form W-4. If they require additional withholding, they should submit a new Form W-4 and, if necessary, pay estimated tax by filing Form 1040-ES or by making an electronic payment of estimated taxes. Employees who receive tips may provide funds to their employer for withholding on tips; see _Collecting taxes on tips_ in section 6. 

**Exemption from federal income tax withholding.** Generally, an employee may claim exemption from federal income tax withholding because they had no income tax liability last year and expect none this year. See the Form W-4 instructions for more information. However, the wages are still subject to social security and Medicare taxes. See also _Invalid Forms W-4_ , later in this section. 

A Form W-4 claiming exemption from withholding is effective when it is given to the employer and only for that calendar year. To continue to be exempt from withholding, an employee must give you a new Form W-4 by February 15. If the employee doesn't give you a new Form W-4 by February 15, begin withholding as if they had checked the box for Single or Married filing separately in Step 1(c) and made no entries in Step 2, Step 3, or Step 4 of the 2025 Form W-4. If the employee provides a new Form W-4 claiming exemption from withholding on February 16 or later, you may apply it to future wages but don't refund any taxes withheld while the exempt status wasn’t in place. 

**Withholding federal income taxes on the wages of nonresident alien employees.** In general, you must withhold federal income taxes on the wages of nonresident alien employees. However, see Pub. 515 for exceptions to this general rule. See section 5 for more guidance on H-2A visa workers.
