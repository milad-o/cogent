If income, social security, or Medicare taxes that must be withheld aren't withheld or aren't paid, you may be personally liable for the trust fund recovery penalty. See _Trust fund recovery penalty_ in section 11. 

Generally, the use of a third-party payer, such as a PSP or reporting agent, doesn't relieve an employer of the responsibility to ensure tax returns are filed and all taxes are paid or deposited correctly and on time. However, see _Certified professional employer organization (CPEO)_ , in section 16, for an exception. 

**Don't file more than one return per return period.** Employers with multiple locations or divisions must file only one Form 941 per quarter or one Form 944 per year. An agricultural employer must file only one Form 943 per year. A payer of nonpayroll payments that withheld federal income tax or backup withholding must file only one Form 945 per year. Filing more than one return may result in processing delays and may require correspondence between you and the IRS. For information on making adjustments to previously filed returns, see section 13. 

## **Reminders about filing.** 

- Don't report more than 1 calendar quarter on a Form 941. 

- If you need Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945, go to _IRS.gov/Forms_ . Also see _Ordering Employer Tax Forms, Instructions, and Publications_ , earlier. 

- Enter your name and EIN on Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945. Be sure they’re exactly as they appeared on earlier returns. 

- See the Instructions for Form 941, Instructions for Form 943, Instructions for Form 944, or Instructions for Form 945 for information on preparing the form. 

**Final return.** If you go out of business, you must file a final return for the last quarter (last year for Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945) in which wages (nonpayroll payments for Form 945) are paid. If you continue to pay wages or other compensation for periods following termination of your business, you must file returns for those periods. See the Instructions for Form 941, Instructions for Form 943, Instructions for Form 944, or Instructions for Form 945 for details on how to file a final return. 

If you’re required to file a final return, you’re also required to furnish Forms W-2 to your employees and file Forms W-2 and W-3 with the SSA by the due date of your final return. Don't send an original or copy of your Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944 to the SSA. See the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 for more information. Employers in Puerto Rico, see the Instructions for Form W-3 (PR) and Form W-3C (PR). 

**Filing late returns for previous years.** Get a copy of Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, or Form 945 (and separate instructions) with a revision date showing the year, and, if applicable, quarter for which your delinquent return is being filed. Prior year and/or quarterly Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, and Form 945 are available, respectively, 

at _IRS.gov/Form941_ , _IRS.gov/Form943_ , _IRS.gov/ Form944_ , and _IRS.gov/Form945_ (select the link for all form revisions under "Other items you may find useful"). Also, see _Ordering Employer Tax Forms, Instructions, and Publications_ , earlier. Contact the IRS at 800-829-4933 if you have any questions about filing late returns.

**Reconciling Forms W-2 and W-3 with Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944.** When there are discrepancies between Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944 filed with the IRS and Forms W-2 and W-3 filed with the SSA, the IRS or the SSA may contact you to resolve the discrepancies. 

- Take the following steps to help reduce discrepancies. 

1. Report bonuses as wages and as social security and Medicare wages on Forms W-2 and on Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944. 

2. Report both social security and Medicare wages and taxes separately on Forms W-2 and W-3, and on Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944. 

3. Report the employee share of social security taxes on Form W-2 in the box for social security tax withheld (box 4), not as social security wages. On Form 499R-2/W-2PR, social security tax withheld is reported in box 21. 

4. Report the employee share of Medicare taxes on Form W-2 in the box for Medicare tax withheld (box 6), not as Medicare wages. On Form 499R-2/ W-2PR, Medicare tax withheld is reported in box 23. 

5. Make sure the social security wage amount for each employee doesn't exceed the annual social security wage base limit ($176,100 for 2025). 

6. Don't report noncash wages that aren't subject to social security or Medicare taxes, as discussed earlier under _Wages not paid in money_ in section 5, as social security or Medicare wages. 

7. If you used an EIN on any Forms 941, Form 943, or Form 944 for the year that is different from the EIN reported on Form W-3, enter the other EIN on Form W-3 in the box for “Other EIN used this year” (box h). On
