_An individual with an ITIN who later becomes eli-_ **!** _gible to work in the United States must obtain an_ **CAUTION** _SSN. If the individual is currently eligible to work in the United States, instruct the individual to apply for an SSN and follow the instructions under_ Applying for an SSN _, earlier in this section. Don't use an ITIN in place of an SSN on Form W-2._ 

**Verification of SSNs.** Employers and authorized reporting agents can use the Social Security Number Verification Service (SSNVS) to instantly verify that an employee name matches an SSN for up to 10 names and SSNs (per screen) at a time, or submit an electronic file of up to 250,000 names and SSNs and usually receive the results the next business day. Go to _SSA.gov/employer/ssnv.htm_ for more information. A person may have a valid SSN but not be authorized to work in the United States. Employers may use E-Verify at _E-Verify.gov_ to confirm the employment eligibility of newly hired employees. 

_**Accessing the SSNVS.**_ The SSA’s BSO is used to access the SSNVS. BSO users will need a social security online account. You can use your personal _my Social Security_ account that was created before September 18, 2021, or an existing _Login.gov_ credential or _ID.me_ credential. If you don’t have a social security online account, a _Login.gov_ credential, or an _ID.me_ credential, you’ll need to create one. For more information, go to the SSA’s website at _SSA.gov/bso_ . 

## **5. Wages and Other Compensation** 

Wages subject to federal employment taxes generally include all pay you give to an employee for services performed. The pay may be in cash or in other forms. It includes salaries, vacation allowances, bonuses, commissions, and taxable fringe benefits. It doesn't matter how you measure or make the payments. Amounts an employer pays as a bonus for signing or ratifying a contract in connection with the establishment of an employer-employee relationship and an amount paid to an employee for cancellation of an employment contract and relinquishment of contract rights are wages subject to social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes and income tax withholding. Also, compensation paid to a former employee for services performed while still employed is wages subject to employment taxes. 

**Cash wages paid to farmworkers.** Cash wages that you pay to employees for farmwork are generally subject to social security tax and Medicare tax. You may also be required to withhold, deposit, and report Additional Medicare Tax. See section 9 for more information. If the wages are subject to social security and Medicare taxes, they’re also subject to federal income tax withholding. You’re liable for the payment of these taxes to the federal government whether or not you collect them from your employees. If, for example, you withhold less than the correct tax 

from an employee's wages, you’re still liable for the full amount. You may also be liable for FUTA tax, which isn't withheld by you or paid by the employee. FUTA tax is discussed in section 14. Cash wages include checks, money orders, and any kind of money or cash.

**Noncash wages, including commodity wages, paid to farmworkers.** Noncash wages include food, lodging, clothing, transportation passes, farm products, or other goods or commodities.
