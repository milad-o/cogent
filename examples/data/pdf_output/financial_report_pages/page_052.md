## **16. Third-Party Payer Arrangements** 

An employer may outsource some or all of its federal employment tax withholding, reporting, and payment obligations. An employer who outsources payroll and related tax duties (that is, withholding, reporting, and paying over social security, Medicare, FUTA, and income taxes) to a third-party payer will generally remain responsible for those duties, including liability for the taxes. However, see _Certified professional employer organization (CPEO)_ , later in this section, for an exception. 

If an employer outsources some or all of its payroll responsibilities, the employer should consider the following information. 

- The employer remains responsible for federal tax deposits and other federal tax payments even though the employer may forward the tax amounts to the third-party payer to make the deposits and payments. If the third party fails to make the deposits and payments, the IRS may assess penalties and interest on the employer’s account. As the employer, you may be liable for all taxes, penalties, and interest due. The employer may also be held personally liable for certain unpaid federal taxes. 

- If the employer’s account has any issues, the IRS will send correspondence to the employer at the address of record. We strongly recommend that the employer maintain its address as the address of record with the IRS. Having correspondence sent to the address of the third-party payer may significantly limit the employer’s ability to be informed about tax matters involving the employer’s business. Use Form 8822-B to update your business address. 

- When a third party enrolls an employer in EFTPS for federal tax deposits, the employer will receive an Inquiry PIN. The employer should activate and use this Inquiry PIN to monitor its account and ensure the third party is making the required tax deposits. 

The following are common third-party payers who an employer may contract with to perform payroll and related tax duties. 

- Payroll service provider (PSP). 

- Reporting agent. 

- Agent with approved Form 2678. 

- Payer designated under section 3504. 

- Certified professional employer organization (CPEO). 

**Payroll service provider (PSP).** A PSP helps administer payroll and payroll-related tax duties on behalf of the employer. A PSP may prepare paychecks for employees, prepare and file employment tax returns, prepare Forms W-2, and make federal tax deposits and other federal tax payments. A PSP performs these functions using the EIN of the employer. A PSP isn't liable as either an employer or 

an agent of the employer for the employer’s employment taxes. If an employer is using a PSP to perform its tax duties, the employer remains liable for its employment tax obligations, including liability for employment taxes. 

An employer who uses a PSP should ensure the PSP is using EFTPS to make federal tax deposits on behalf of the employer so the employer can confirm that the payments are being made on its behalf. 

**Reporting agent.** A reporting agent is a type of PSP. A reporting agent helps administer payroll and payroll-related tax duties on behalf of the employer, including authorization to electronically sign and file forms set forth on Form 8655. An employer uses Form 8655 to authorize a reporting agent to perform functions on behalf of the employer. A reporting agent performs these functions using the EIN of the employer. A reporting agent isn't liable as either an employer or an agent of the employer for the employer’s employment taxes. If an employer is using a reporting agent to perform its tax duties, the employer remains liable for its employment obligations, including liability for employment taxes. 

A reporting agent must use EFTPS to make federal tax deposits on behalf of an employer. The employer has access to EFTPS to confirm federal tax deposits were made on its behalf. 

For more information on reporting agents, see Revenue Procedure 2012-32, 2012-34 I.R.B. 267, available at _IRS.gov/irb/2012-34_IRB#RP-2012-32_ ; and Pub. 1474, Technical Specifications Guide for Reporting Agent Authorization and Federal Tax Depositors. 

**Agent with an approved Form 2678.** An agent with an approved Form 2678 helps administer payroll and related tax duties on behalf of the employer. An agent authorized under section 3504 may pay wages or compensation to some or all of the employees of an employer, prepare and file employment tax returns as set forth on Form 2678, prepare Forms W-2, and make federal tax deposits and other federal tax payments. An employer uses Form 2678 to request authorization to appoint an agent to perform functions on behalf of the employer. An agent with an approved Form 2678 is authorized to perform these functions using its own EIN. The agent files a Schedule R (Form 941) or, if applicable, Schedule R (Form 943) to allocate wages, taxes, and credits claimed to the employers it represents as an agent. 

If an employer is using an agent with an approved Form 2678 to perform its tax duties, the agent and the employer are jointly liable for the employment taxes and related tax duties for which the agent is authorized to perform. 

Form 2678 doesn't apply to FUTA taxes reportable on Form 940 unless the employer is a home care service recipient receiving home care services through a program administered by a federal, state, or local government agency. 

For more information on an agent with an approved Form 2678, see Revenue Procedure 2013-39, 2013-52 I.R.B. 830, available at _IRS.gov/irb/ 2013-52_IRB#RP-2013-39_ .
