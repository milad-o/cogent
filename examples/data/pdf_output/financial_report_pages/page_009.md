## **Dishonored Payments** 

Any form of payment that is dishonored and returned from a financial institution is subject to a penalty. The penalty is $25 or 2% of the payment, whichever is more. However, the penalty on dishonored payments of $24.99 or less is an amount equal to the payment. For example, a dishonored payment of $18 is charged a penalty of $18.

## **Ordering Employer Tax Forms, Instructions, and Publications** 

You can view, download, or print most of the forms, instructions, and publications you may need at _IRS.gov/ Forms_ . Otherwise, you can go to _IRS.gov/OrderForms_ to place an order and have them mailed to you. The IRS will 

process your order as soon as possible. Don't resubmit requests you've already sent us. You can get forms, instructions, and publications faster online. 

Instead of ordering paper Forms W-2 and W-3, consider filing them electronically using the SSA's free _e-file_ service. Go to the SSA's Employer W-2 Filing Instructions & Information webpage at _SSA.gov/employer_ to learn more about Business Services Online (BSO). You’ll be able to create Forms W-2 online and submit them to the SSA by typing your wage information into easy-to-use fill-in fields. In addition, you can print out completed copies of Forms W-2 to file with state or local governments, distribute to your employees, and keep for your records. Form W-3 will be created for you based on your Forms W-2. 

The SSA's BSO is an independent program from the Government of Puerto Rico electronic filing system. Employers in Puerto Rico must go to _Hacienda.pr.gov_ for additional information. 

## **Photographs of Missing Children** 

The IRS is a proud partner with the _National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC)_ . Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in this publication on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678) if you recognize a child. 

## **Calendar** 

The following is a list of important dates and responsibilities. The dates listed here haven’t been adjusted for Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays (see the _TIP_ next). Pub. 509, Tax Calendars (for use in 2025), adjusts the dates for Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. See section 11 for information about depositing taxes reported on Form 941, Form 943, Form 944, and Form 945. See section 14 for information about depositing FUTA tax. Due dates for forms required for health coverage reporting aren't listed here. For these dates, see Pub. 509. 

_If any date shown next for filing a return, furnishing_ **TIP** _a form, or depositing taxes falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is the next business day. The term "legal holiday" means any legal holiday in the District of Columbia. A statewide legal holiday delays a filing due date only if the IRS office where you’re required to file is located in that state. However, a statewide legal holiday doesn't delay the due date of federal tax deposits. See_ Deposits Due on Business Days Only _in section 11. For any filing due date, you’ll meet the “file” or “furnish” requirement if the envelope containing the return or form is properly addressed, contains sufficient postage, and is postmarked by the U.S. Postal_
