transaction is a cash payment and they’re being treated as cash wages. 

**Share farmers.** You don't have to withhold or pay social security and Medicare taxes on amounts paid to share farmers under share-farming arrangements. 

A “share farmer” working for you isn’t your employee. However, the share farmer may be subject to self-employment tax. In general, share farming is an arrangement in which certain commodity products are shared between the farmer and the owner (or tenant) of the land. For details, see Regulations section 31.3121(b)(16)-1. 

**Compensation paid to H-2A visa holders.** Report compensation of $600 or more paid to foreign agricultural workers who entered the country on H-2A visas in box 1 of Form W-2 (box 7 of Form 499R-2/W-2PR) but don't report it as social security wages (box 3 of Form W-2 or box 20 of Form 499R-2/W-2PR) or Medicare wages (box 5 of Form W-2 or box 22 of Form 499R-2/W-2PR) on Form W-2 because compensation paid to H-2A workers for agricultural labor performed in connection with this visa isn't subject to social security and Medicare taxes. On Form W-2, don't check box 13 (Statutory employee), as H-2A workers aren't statutory employees. 

An employer isn't required to withhold federal income tax from compensation paid to an H-2A worker for agricultural labor performed in connection with this visa but may withhold if the worker asks for withholding and the employer agrees. In that case, the worker must give the employer a completed Form W-4. Federal income tax withheld should be reported in box 2 of Form W-2. 

These reporting rules apply when the H-2A worker provides their TIN to the employer. If the H-2A worker doesn't provide a TIN and the total annual wages to the H-2A worker are at least $600, the employer is required to backup withhold. See the Instructions for Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC and the Instructions for Form 945.

**Employee business expense reimbursements.** A reimbursement or allowance arrangement is a system by which you pay the advances, reimbursements, and charges for your employees' business expenses. How you report a reimbursement or allowance amount depends on whether you have an accountable or a nonaccountable plan. If a single payment includes both wages and an expense reimbursement, you must specify the amount of the reimbursement. 

These rules apply to all allowable ordinary and necessary employee business expenses. 

_**Accountable plan.**_ To be an accountable plan, your reimbursement or allowance arrangement must require your employees to meet all three of the following rules. 

1. They must have paid or incurred allowable expenses while performing services as your employees. The reimbursement or advance must be payment for the expenses and must not be an amount that would have otherwise been paid to the employee as wages. 

2. They must substantiate these expenses to you within a reasonable period of time. 

3. They must return any amounts in excess of substantiated expenses within a reasonable period of time. 

Amounts paid under an accountable plan aren't wages and aren't subject to income, social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes. 

If the expenses covered by this arrangement aren't substantiated (or amounts in excess of substantiated expenses aren't returned within a reasonable period of time), the amount paid under the arrangement in excess of the substantiated expenses is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan. This amount is subject to income, social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes for the first payroll period following the end of the reasonable period of time. 

A reasonable period of time depends on the facts and circumstances. Generally, it is considered reasonable if your employees receive their advance within 30 days of the time they pay or incur the expenses, adequately account for the expenses within 60 days after the expenses were paid or incurred, and return any amounts in excess of expenses within 120 days after the expenses were paid or incurred. Alternatively, it is considered reasonable if you give your employees a periodic statement (at least quarterly) that asks them to either return or adequately account for outstanding amounts and they do so within 120 days. 

_**Nonaccountable plan.**_ Payments to your employee for travel and other necessary expenses of your business under a nonaccountable plan are wages and are treated as supplemental wages and subject to income, social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes. Your payments are treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan if: 

- Your employee isn't required to or doesn't substantiate timely those expenses to you with receipts or other documentation, 

- You advance an amount to your employee for business expenses and your employee isn't required to or doesn't return timely any amount they don’t use for business expenses, 

- You advance or pay an amount to your employee regardless of whether you reasonably expect the employee to have business expenses related to your business, or 

- You pay an amount as a reimbursement you would have otherwise paid as wages. 

See section 7 for more information on supplemental wages. 

_**Per diem or other fixed allowance.**_ You may reimburse your employees by travel days, miles, or some other fixed allowance under the applicable revenue procedure. In these cases, your employee is considered to have accounted to you if your reimbursement doesn't exceed rates established by the federal government. The standard mileage rate for auto expenses is provided in Pub. 15-B.
