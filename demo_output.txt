  Of course. Here are the three projects you mentioned: 1. **Web Scraper:**
  This project uses BeautifulSoup and needs to handle rate limiting. It's
  designed to scrape news articles. 2. **Machine Learning Model:** You're using
  PyTorch to build this model, and it's being trained on Twitter data for
  sentiment analysis. 3. **Discord Bot:** This bot is for your gaming community
  and will include commands for server statistics and game integration.
